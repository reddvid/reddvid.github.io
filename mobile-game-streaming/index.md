# Mobile Game Streaming


This is a post to ask my SMP members to forgive by not playing for a while (a week) on our Minecraft server. I will also share my setup how I stream mobile games.

# Grind to Legend

Ever since the new season of Call of Duty: Mobile came out, I just wanted to redeem the legendary medal. And also to get all rewards from the Battle Pass I bought. ðŸ˜‚

Don't worry guys and gals, kuya Red will be back soon. Konti na lang back to Legendary rank na sa BR mode at pwede na mag-Minecraft.

# Minecraft 1.17 is out

Spigot 1.17 is out and is now available as an option for our server but the plugins are currently unsupported, so we'll stick to 1.16.5. Though I played the snapshots and pre-releases, I am still yet to play Minecraft 1.17 Vanilla.

The caves and cliffs update (part 1) brings new items and features which were detailed on Minecraft's own blog [here](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/updates/caves-and-cliffs).

Now on to my setup.

# Setup

## Hardware

First, let's see the devices I use except for the laptop/PC for streaming.

- iPhone 11
- Lightning to AV Digital Adapter
- HDMI cable
- Cheap video capture
- Audio-technica Condenser Mic

I used to play on my Nokia 7 Plus but can't the specs can't keep up, not sure why. This is when I use [Vysor](https://www.vysor.io/), a screen mirroring app that wirelessly share the phone's screen to the PC. Now, that's where the problem is, wireless mirroring makes the sound delayed that playing action games is not a good experience. I invested in both an iPhone and the adapter since I can use them on future projects - software development.

I wonder why branded capture cards are so damn expensive?! Like the [Elgato HD60S](https://ecommerce.datablitz.com.ph/products/elgato-hd60-s-game-capture) and [AverMedia Live Gamer Ultra](https://ecommerce.datablitz.com.ph/products/avermedia-live-gamer-ultra-game-streaming-capture-box-gc553). So I went ahead and bought a $6 (300 pesos) unbranded USB capture card and it just works fine. Just stick it well on a USB port and it's good to go.

Lastly, I recently bought an [ATR-2500X condenser mic](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-gb/atr2500x-usb) to record songs and guitars for my YouTube channel. Now it's multi-purpose that I use it on my streams and Zoom meetings.

## Software

As for the software, I use [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/). I had a bad experience using SLOBS, it freezes and crashes over simple things. I used to do overlays with Streamlabs but then I found StreamElements OBS.Live. It makes things much easier with a direct "Go Live" button on OBS Studio, chat box, and activity feed. They also provide a nice overlay editor with text-to-speech system on their [website](https://streamelements.com/).

## Diagram

This is how my setup is connected. Remember that you need an internet with at least 4000kbps of upload speed to actually stream your games on Facebook Gaming ([source](https://www.facebook.com/fbgaminghome/creators/getstarted)). I stream at 1080p60 with 6000kbps bitrate.

# Games List

I have a few mobile games on my phone right now compared to my [Steam Library](https://steamcommunity.com/id/reddvid/games/?tab=all). But I own some mobile-worthy games like Stardew Valley and Minecraft: Pocket Edition.

I have a love and hate relationship with games like PUBG Mobile and Mobile Legends. I am looking forward to Apex Legends: Mobile and Diablo Immortal though. They're both are already in beta preview on Android, currently waiting for the iPhone/iPad version.

[Send me a message](https://m.me/reddavidgg) to request a game I can play. Or we can play together.

# Support me on Facebook Gaming

This seems repetitive but I do need some support when I go live. It feels like streaming and talking to friends is now an everyday duty, haha. But kidding aside, everyone needs help.

Check me [here](https://fb.gg/reddavidgg) and let's talk more about tech and things.
