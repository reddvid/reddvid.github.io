# RF Tools Gets Multi-Window Support


UWP SDK recently released a new support for Multi-windowing.

Then I though of which of my apps should I implement this with, there's nothing better than RF Tools, a calculator app for engineers and enthusiasts of radio frequency.

This should improve the user's experience by doing multiple calculations visible at once; to compare and serve as a history.
