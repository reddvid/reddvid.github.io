    <title>OBS Studio 27 is here</title>

            </div><p>I just updated my OBS a few days ago with the official release version after trying out the several release candidates.</p>
<p>I will talk about the new features and improvements here that will be useful for my use. Check their blog post <a href="https://obsproject.com/blog/obs-studio-27-released" target="_blank">here</a> and the complete changelog <a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/27.0.0" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
<br>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LUkMxYNIyj0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<br>
<h1 id="undo--redo-5000">Undo &amp; Redo (5000)</h1>
<p>At last! No more annoyances when you just ACCIDENTALLY move something on the canvas. Undo and redo is here for every change you do in your sources and scenes - not sure for all filters though. And that’s 5000 actions.</p>
<p>Though I mostly use OBS for game streaming (no facecam), I move things around only to notice that it was not the source I wanted to move! This surely helps users out and always had been the most requested feature.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="files-where">Files, where?</h1>
<p>Version 27 also added a missing files window prompt on launch that allows us to relocate or ignore the missing files. Nice addition so we don’t go start streaming only to have the files missing.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Missing Files Warning Window</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<h1 id="no-more-noise">No More Noise</h1>
<p>OBS v27 for Windows now adds NVIDIA Noise Removal as an option to audio Noise Suppression filter when the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-sdk/resources/" target="_blank">NVIDIA Audio Effects SDK</a> is installed. Oh, also you need an NVIDIA RTX GPU for that - so no screenshots from me.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="improvements">Improvements</h1>
<p>Thanks for these 2 new improvements among others:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browser Source interact button (toolbar)</li>
<li>Virtual Camera toggle button (system tray)</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image">

<br/>
<br>
<h1 id="fin">Fin</h1>
<p>This new version of OBS Studio definitely helps with the new added features. Now I want a selective record feature.</p>
<p>I use OBS Studio together with <a href="https://streamelements.com/" target="_blank">StreamElements</a> OBS Live to simplify my stream setup to Facebook Gaming. I now have 1,019 followers (as of this writing) and why not check me out there? Maybe talk about gaming, life, or programming? <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG/" target="_blank">RedDavidGG on Facebook Gaming</a></p>
<p>I dedicate the starwall page for my stars-sender. Thanks and make sure to check out OBS Studio’s latest release <a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

    <title>RPN Radio UI Overhaul</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/rpnradio-ui-overhaul/</link>
    <pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 00:15:36 &#43;0800</pubDate>

                <img src="/images/feat/rpnradio-ui.jpeg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>Browsing Instagram on my account now floods me with several UI/UX tips and practices, making me inspired to update and retouch my apps with some latest trends in mobile designs.</p>
<h1 id="old-look">Old Look</h1>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at what the app looked like before the update:</p>
<figure class="image">


<figcaption><em>Old UI</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>Though it looked intuitive - with just two simple steps: 1) Launch app, 2) Select station and Listen; the main page does not give the user context on what the app does, which raise this question:</p>
<p><strong><em>What am I supposed to do?</em></strong></p>
<h2 id="menu-list">Menu List</h2>
<p>At first glance of a first-time user, the stations list does NOT show that it is &ldquo;clickable&rdquo;. So the first UI update was to change the 4x3 grid to a simple list.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Station Menu Item Before and After</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>This subtle change provides the user a hint of &ldquo;click me&rdquo; by giving the list item a design of a button. It also gave a space for the station&rsquo;s detail to be added - station&rsquo;s location and live/offline status.</p>
<h2 id="header-and-controls">Header and Controls</h2>
<p>Ok, this area will look crammed especially on small-screen devices. Before this update though, I repositioned the buttons below the controls and were still crammed. This update allowed the horizontal list to be scrolled.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Header & Controls Before and After</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>I also changed the text that shows the current stations into a simpler one and updated the share icon.</p>
<h2 id="new-font">New Font</h2>
<p>I like <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Poppins</a>.
<br></p>
<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>Besides the UI updates mentioned above, I added an &ldquo;About&rdquo; page. It is a simple about and external links of RPN.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>About page</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<h1 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h1>
<p>These are my to-do list for the app, which we will see soon on future updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>No internet connection status</li>
<li>Bottom player controls (Priority)</li>
<li>App-aware sharing</li>
<li>Rate and review prompt</li>
<li>Links to station email/messaging</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="downloads">Downloads</h1>
<p>As always, the app is still available for Android and (REALLY) soon for iOS.</p>
<p>Google Play Store: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rpnradio.radiov1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rpnradio.radiov1</a></p>

    <title>Unlocked: 1K Followers</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/unlocked-1k-followers/</link>

                <img src="/images/feat/1k-followers.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>First of all, thank you so much to all who stayed, watched, and enjoyed my content.</p>
<p>It was on May 26th that we finally got to a thousand following after a year of starting to be a Gaming Video Creator on Facebook. The stream felt like another day of chill streaming by playing a couple of hours of Minecraft. It was quite overwhelming for a small-time (and not full-time) streamer like me but thanks to my cousins and og supporters for helping me out in the chat and Discord server.</p>
<figure class="image">

</figure>
<br/>
<h1 id="strikedailystrike-nightly-streams"><strike>Daily</strike> Nightly Streams</h1>
<p>Now that there&rsquo;s that 1K following behind me, I will pursue to stream on a daily basis, even a short one because honestly, I miss talking and updating with them. I will also continue to improve my stream quality.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="not-minecraft-hello">Not Minecraft, Hello?</h1>
<p>Minecraft is a really popular game we all know that, and most of my followers were because of the game. I do not expect everyone to like me playing variety of games but I still hope most could support me when I come back playing other types of games. Although, I would still join our SMP server if I fail to stream Minecraft.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="twitchyoutube-switch">Twitch/YouTube Switch</h1>
<p>Yes, I have been thinking of switching to either one, why? First, Twitch have several audience interaction which I have been using when I watch my favorite streamers there like, watch points, play with viewers, etc and you can watch on app minimized.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Watch Twitch Videos Minimized</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>While YouTube had a better chat system, but chat highlights and audience interactions are better - with chatbots.</p>
<p>I held back these thoughts before since I did start my Facebook page a long time and gained a few followers. I just hoped if I made up my mind to switch, we can determine the real supporters. Maybe?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for this blog post. Thank you again for visiting my website and you can catch up on my Gaming Videos on <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook Gaming</a> and follower me there. You can also follow me on my socials: @reddvid</p>

    <title>Streaming Again &amp; Minecraft SMP Season 2</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/minecraft-smp-season-2/</link>

            </div><p>Rejoice! My more-than-a-month-long hiatus finally came to an end - I&rsquo;m back to streaming video games in Facebook Gaming. In just 2 days, I&rsquo;ve managed to garner a whopping 8+ hours as compared before.</p>
<p>This also means that I am back to relieving some stress thru my beloved game Minecraft, (Survival Mode).</p>
<h1 id="first-world">First World?</h1>
<p>The first server I rented became <strike>toxic</strike> unenjoyable after a few months after opening it into the public - NO it&rsquo;s not because of the new players, but because the server was technically &ldquo;DONE&rdquo; by having usable XP farms, stripped mines, food source, and other auto AFK farms. Which meant that new players have nothing more to do but mess around most of the time.</p>
<p>I tried to reload the server with a new world but it kept corrupting upto the point that I reverted it back to the older (toxic) world. And I stopped playing less and less.</p>
<h1 id="refreshed-and-new-season-two">Refreshed and New? SEASON TWO</h1>
<p>Yes, after I decided to stream again, I hastily rented a new server and invite some of my OG followers to play with me. As of now, the world is still peaceful and managed to invite more players in hoping we can live happily in the upcoming days.</p>
<p>Unlike before, the server is now Offline-mode, meaning that non-Mojang accounts can now join - be CAREFUL though, WE CAN STILL <strong>BAN</strong> YOU.</p>
<h2 id="wanna-join">Wanna join?</h2>
<p>Head over to our Discord server for the rules and guidelines, and for the Server IP.</p>

<h1 id="hello-1k-followers">Hello 1K Followers</h1>
<p>I have been aiming to reach followers before the year 2020 ends but I failed to do so, much more that I stopped streaming for more than a month.</p>
<p>Now with regained confidence, I am on the path to reach that goal while improving my streaming. So head over to my <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook Gaming Page</a> and see if you like me to gain a Follow!</p>
<h1 id="looking-for-support">✨Looking for Support</h1>
<p>Also, I tried streaming mobile games now and then but the current setup is not suited for it. I am slowly building funds to get the setup for mobile games too.</p>

<h1 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h1>
<p>I viewed some designs online and found inspiration from <a href="https://get-thrive.app/" target="_blank">Thrive</a>, which I never heard of - thanks anyway!</p>

<p>The webpage is available <a href="https://reddavid.me/zipcodeph-app" target="_blank">HERE</a>. The page is still a link to my website but will soon acquire a domain for it soon. Also, the page is still a basic design but complete with the download links, which I will improve soon.</p>
<p>Will keep you updated!</p>

    <title>[Update: NOW AVAILABLE] ZIP Code PH for iOS</title>

            </div><h1 id="update-now-available">Update: Now Available</h1>
<p>You can get the app from App Store (iPhone and iPad) for only Php49 (US$0.99) - sorry for the paywall. I&rsquo;m still a struggling developer and just to let you know, developing for Apple costs more compared to Windows and Google Play Store.</p>
<p>Get the app below: <br/>
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zip-code-ph/id1555921863?itsct=apps_box&amp;itscg=30200" style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; border-radius: 13px; width: 250px; height: 83px;"></a></p>

<h1 id="lets-go">Let&rsquo;s Go</h1>
<p>For the last few weeks, I spent my free time building my app, ZIP Code PH, for iOS using Apple&rsquo;s native language SwiftUI.</p>
<p>Using a Mac is not that hard anymore since I&rsquo;ve test ran macOS Catalina on VirtualBox. I managed to run XCode and tried to tinker with the language, and built some UI mockups.</p>
<p>And luckily, the workplace has acquired a mac mini to cater Apple users for our apps (which is coming as soon as possible). I will also be the one developing the iOS apps, so check them out soon.</p>
<h1 id="development">Development</h1>
<h2 id="main-and-about-page">Main and About Page</h2>
<p>I am fairly new to SwiftUI so converting? the codes I used for Windows and Xamarin Android app - XAML and C# - will be useless. It took a few days to build the bare UI. I started with the Main Page and the Help page since they don&rsquo;t consume a lot of code-behind.</p>
<p>The Main Page took a lot of iterations but below is the final view (as of this writing):</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Main Page</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>The Help/About Page contains the same details I used in the Android app except that I added attributions to the new images in the Main Page (thanks <a href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_blank">Unsplash!</a>)</p>
<figure class="image">


<figcaption><em>Help & About Page</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<h2 id="search-page">Search Page</h2>
<p>Next up is the Search Page, I coded this before the menus since the code-behind logic is much simpler since we will use all the zip codes instead of filtering them to areas.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t explorer SwiftUI that much but I found this code to build the Search bar iOS-style:</p>

<p>I spent a few times making the search (filtering) logic work the way I wanted that I almost gave up with SwiftUI programming 😅</p>
<h2 id="menu-and-area-list-page">Menu and Area List Page</h2>
<p>After understanding the filtering code while developing the Search Page, it is time to code the Menu and Area pages. The UI looks a lot like the Android counterpart but the built-in Title style for iOS makes the UI better by collapsing the title to inline when scrolled. This is how it looks like on version 1.0.4</p>

<p>Now the challenge begins, how to implement favorites - saving and loading data - while making the UI flexible when an item is added to favorites.</p>
<p>After more than a week of mind-bending development, I made it to work with the help of stackoverflow 😅. (Every developer use it, right? Right?)</p>

            </div><p>Here we go again folks! Another PC upgrade, this time we take our storage to the next level.</p>
<h1 id="top-player">Top Player</h1>
<p>I just bought a Samsung 970 EVO Plus, 1TB for my &ldquo;coding needs&rdquo;. I recently experience a throttle while using my current XPG 500GB - I have been using some Virtual Machines lately to test out some things, and the SSD space gets loaded up quickly.</p>
<p>The SSD costs me around US$100 and failed to get a cheaper one since I am not paying the whole price - again, I got this for credit. 😅</p>
<h1 id="samsung-why">Samsung, why?</h1>
<p>Samsung has been the top brand for SSDs and I can say this myself since personally, I used an 860 EVO in the past for my laptop. And even though my current XPG SSD does it&rsquo;s job, I needed an storage upgrade and it&rsquo;s time to get this one.</p>
<p>The technical specs and comparison is available in the internet which you can visit on PCWorld, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3334876/samsung-970-evo-plus-review-samsungs-entry-level-nvme-ssd-is-faster-and-cheaper.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung 970 EVO Plus review</a></p>
<h1 id="take-a-look">Take a Look</h1>
<p>I forgot to take pictures to avoid the SSD from picking up some static from my desk mat. But I did take a picture of the box before installing it on the system.</p>

<p>This is not to flaunt the things I have, I&rsquo;m just trying to share my thoughts and share which can help my daily activities like coding, and file and graphics processing.</p>

    <title>Flutter Coding</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/flutter-coding/</link>
    <pubDate>Mon, 15 Mar 2021 22:06:53 &#43;0800</pubDate>
    <author>Author</author>
    <guid>https://reddavid.me/flutter-coding/</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/feat/android-love-flutter.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>I&rsquo;ve heard about Flutter a long time ago but never actually used it or read in-depth about it. But I knew it was a UI framework from Google which uses a single code-base for mobile and web apps.</p>
<p>As you may know now, I developed some apps for Android and iOS using their native languages - Java and SwiftUI - and not a single-codebase language like Flutter. But I did try to code the RPN Radio app using Xamarin.Forms but the implementation of the Audio Players s*cks a$$ to be honest.</p>
<p>Coding with their native languages was just a personal challenge for me being tech-savvy and wanted to experiment and dive myself to their &ldquo;native world&rdquo;.</p>
<h1 id="android-and-bad-java-code">Android and Bad (Java) Code</h1>
<p>The Android Java code stuff was working - well, not that well - the implementation of the player was frequently bugged that it causes the app to crash. I tried several work arounds to the code to prevent the nasties, until I realized this is bad code.</p>
<p>To satisfy myself, and the users, I challenged myself to rebuild the app using Flutter.</p>
<p>Ever since March started, I started reading about Flutter and did some basic UI.</p>
<p>But first, let me tell you how I installed Flutter on Windows.</p>
<h1 id="pre-installation-pre-requisites">Pre-installation (Pre-requisites?)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have Git on your device. I installed Git for Windows</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve had Android Studio installed on my system ever since I coded for Android, which is also a recommended IDE for Flutter.</li>
<li>Some Android SDKs and;</li>
<li>Google Chrome browser.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<p>I pretty much followed the recommended guide as stated here: <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Install Flutter (Windows)</a>. But instead of <code>C:\src\flutter</code>, I put it a level higher like this: <code>C:\flutter</code>.</p>
<p>Then added environment variable to Path. &lt;- This part is important if you want to run flutter commands in the command line</p>
<p>Ran <code>flutter doctor</code> until all requirements are check out</p>
<h1 id="ide-wait">IDE, wait&hellip;</h1>
<p>My IDE of choice is Android Studio, so I can use the emulators I already created and to avoid any additional setup when choosing another.</p>
<p>Upon opening the IDE, it was said that creating a new Flutter project should be there on the menu screen but it was missing!</p>
<p>Even though <code>flutter doctor</code> checked everything, I was disappointed that I can&rsquo;t start right away. Scraping the internet for solutions, I checked Android Studio&rsquo;s configuration and there, I downloaded some Flutter and Dart plugins which after a software restart, I can now create a new Flutter project.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>New Flutter Project</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>Since, the app I am planning to rebuild in Flutter is single-paged, it is a good starting-point to play around the Flutter widgets.</p>
<p>Coming from XAML, where everything seems &ldquo;as is&rdquo;, I am so uncomfortable about coding UI using script-like codes. But having started SwiftUI for a few weeks, I pretty much can stand it. 😅</p>
<figure class="image">

</figure>
<br/>
<h1 id="beginning">Beginning</h1>
<p>Being the beginner, again, I am on my way to building to much more with Flutter with prettier code and nicer implementations.</p>
<p>I am now reading some books and watching some tutorials on YouTube to help me advance a little more each day.</p>
<p>Ever since February began, I have been active to coding again. Learning new stuff that I do enjoy!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading my blog post, and will share some updates on how I would use Flutter sometime soon! Always take care peeps!</p>

    <title>Tune In RPN Radio Update</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/tunein-update/</link>
    <pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2021 20:30:09 &#43;0800</pubDate>
    <author>Author</author>
    <guid>https://reddavid.me/tunein-update/</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/feat/rpn-tunein.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>I updated the tune-in website for RPN. This post will detail the changes, what&rsquo;s new or removed, and how the update went.</p>
<h1 id="mainpage-and-mobile-first-design">MainPage and Mobile-First Design</h1>
<p>The main page remains got a few changes, starting with the font face and size. Before the update, the font family forced to check for <a href="https://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/proxima-nova" target="_blank">Proxima Nova</a> and fallback to Arial Nova or other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif" target="_blank">sans serif fonts.</a></p>
<p>Then I cleaned up my CSS file to make the whole website <a href="https://medium.com/@Vincentxia77/what-is-mobile-first-design-why-its-important-how-to-make-it-7d3cf2e29d00" target="_blank">&ldquo;mobile-first&rdquo;.</a>
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="now-playing-station-pages">Now Playing Station Pages</h1>
<p>The tune-in or now playing page received most of the update. I&rsquo;ve broken some of them below:</p>
<h2 id="back-button">Back Button</h2>
<p>The back button got a lot of love with some logic. At first, the button always takes you to the home (main) page with the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag attribute <code>href=&quot;/&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s got a javascript code that checks for an open navigation menu, and whether the history came from the tunein.rpnradio.com domain.</p>
<pre><code>function goBack() {
  if (isNavOpen) {
    closeNav();
  }
  else if (document.referrer == "") {
    window.location.href = "https://tunein.rpnradio.com/";
  }
  else {
    window.history.back();
  }
}; </code></pre>
<p>This logic was finalized when I opened a page link on my iPhone then the back button took me to the previous page - other site.</p>
<p>Now the back button takes you to home page when started with a station page.</p>
<h2 id="navigation-menu">Navigation Menu</h2>
<p>The station pages got a navigation menu that resembles the home page. This is to give the listener a continuous audio stream playback whilst needing to change a station.</p>
<p>Note: The navigation drawer will not work on browser back button - as I learned with other sites. The browser just simply go back to the previous page.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="security">Security</h1>
<p>The website was also SSL-enabled - <a href="https://www.websecurity.digicert.com/security-topics/https-everywhere" target="_blank">HTTPS Everywhere.</a></p>
<p>This also means that the old stream URLs will not work. Thankfully, the audio servers have secured stream URLs for secure websites.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="open-graph-metadata">Open Graph Metadata</h1>
<p>Social Media sites are the places where websites get the most referrers. So having metadata for them not just makes the website Facebook- or Twitter-friendly but it is a great addition to how it would look like when shared.</p>
<p>Making the images took waaaaay longer than I expected. I decided to add 3 mockup devices that shows the website on these devices. You can see the share preview below:</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Facebook Open Graph Preview</em></figcaption>
<br/>

<figcaption><em>Twitter Open Graph Preview</em></figcaption>
</figure>
Creating the metadata tags was made easy by using <a href="https://metatags.io/" target="_blank">Metatags.io</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
<h1 id="site-icons">Site Icons</h1>
<p>I went on to also update the website&rsquo;s favicons, to differentiate tunein to the news website. It now has the Android app icon below:</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><em>Website Favicon</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<h1 id="google-ads">Google Ads</h1>
<p>I replaced the part suggesting other methods to tunein (Zeno app, Radio Garden and our native Android app) with a Google Auto ad.</p>
<p>We all hate ads but this is the only modest way to profit for most websites.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="htaccess-to-remove-html">.htaccess to Remove .html</h1>
<p>I finally made it to work, shorten the address for site navigation. Instead of showing the full file name: <pre><small>tunein.rpnradio.com/batac.html</small></pre>
Some rules were added to the .htaccess file to make it <pre><small>tunein.rpnradio.com/batac</small></pre></p>
<p>.htaccess file:</p>
<pre><code>RewriteEngine On 
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off 
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]

RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} /([^.]+)\.html [NC]
RewriteRule ^ /%1 [NC,L,R]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}.html -f
RewriteRule ^ %{REQUEST_URI}.html [NC,L]
</code></pre>
<br/>
<h1 id="footer-finally">Footer Finally</h1>
<p>I added a subtle footer to the whole website. That&rsquo;s it. :)
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="final-words">Final Words</h1>
<p>This website is another medium for the company&rsquo;s aim for a greater reach by expanding to Digital Media. In addition to our native apps (which is available for Android - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rpnradio.radiov1&hl=en&gl=US" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a> and <a href="https://appgallery.huawei.com/#/app/C103076031" target="_blank">Huawei App Gallery</a>), the website also serves a means for our audiences to access our stations' broadcast anytime and anywhere in the world.</p>
