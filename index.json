[{"categories":["Stories"],"content":"Why do (or did) I own at least 5 of Logitech G mice despite the “double-clicking” issues about them? As an ECE, I knew that some percentage of any electronics produced out there do have flaws - and this is not an excuse for their price - but in the “real” world, these things can happen. Also, when looking at r/mechanicalkeyboards they combo their awesome keebs with a Logitech mouse despite them hating on Romer-G’s. This is my “short” history on my Logitech mouse shopping and usage. Here it goes: If I recall correctly, my first mouse from Logitech was the G302, it has the odd shape but it just fits nicely in my hand. I used it for almost 2 years until it went “double-clicking” due to playing Dota 2. I just scavenged some old A4tech mouse and took out the switches (Huanos?) to replace one on the G302. The G302 still works today but it has this rattling noise due to the broken plastics inside. Then I bought a G203, a smaller mouse sporting with the new logo. I bought this to have an RGB mouse. This is when I started to jump on the “Logitech mouse hype”. Being on the “hype train”, I impulse bought a G403 when it became available in my country despite my current G203 still works. The G403 was not comfortable for my hand - well, the shops before don’t have demo units - so I bought another G203 as I gave the old one to my GF for office use. The G403 is stored for now. After some time, GF’s workplace decided to renovate so I took the G203 back and decided to “mod” it and cut the wire too short making it unroutable to my home setup. This older G203 is now in my “junk box”. I think all through the year 2019, I was looking to buy their wireless mouse - the G304. It has the same shape as the G203 and has the new HERO sensor. And that one time when I decided to finally buy one, I first asked a salesperson if there were any Logitech promos and I was told that the G Pro was 50% off. Without hesitation, I bought it instead of the G304. The G Pro is physically the same as G203 but has a braided cable, stiffer mouse wheel, and sporting the PMW3366 optical gaming sensor. I use this in the office with a cheap mouse bungee to keep the wire neat. Fast forward March 2020, city-wide was on lockdown, knowing that I would be staying in the office for quite some time, I lend my laptop to my GF for her to use. I also lend her the (working) G203. After some time staying in the office, I decided to neat up my desk and I found it a hassle for wires (with dual monitors, keyboards, USB cords, and whatnot) so I thought, “It’s time to check that G304 I wished for the longest time. And there’s a sale incoming too.” I checked Lazada but I was skeptical to buy electronics from them – to avoid the hassle process of returning a defective product. This is when I learned that my “favorite” gaming store I bought my previous Logitech mice has a “better” website and I checked the G304 and it was cheaper compared to its store retail price. I bought it as a gift for myself this June. Here on my desk right now is the G304 and the G Pro. I use the G304 for daily work and casual games and the G Pro for FPS and competitive gaming. I will be posting my review for the G304 soon. And sorry for the lack of better pictures of my mice.

Sad right? After that sad moment, I tried to repost everything using Hugo, a static website builder, but found that it was too complicated - with YAML, some .scss, layouts, etc. So I gave up and made a basic website with just HTML, CSS, and JS files. It was ok for me, just having a landing page for my apps, other works and a short bio. Until I do wanted to do some blog, not that daily blog but just somewhere to share my thoughts. So here we are again, I would actullay give time to understand Hugo and what not. Welcome me again!

We used VB.Net for the software and C++ for the Arduino microprocessor. After that, I got started in Windows Phone App development and learned C#, XAML, and Git. The first apps I created were mostly for personal-use until I registered and submitted one to the Windows Store. Then I started coding apps which helped me simplify the jobs I do - from monitoring and reporting data and statistics to automating web interactions. What started as a hobby became a small source of income. I have more than a dozen apps available right now in the Windows 10 Store. And right now, I am learning web development and looking forward to get a Microsoft Certification.
