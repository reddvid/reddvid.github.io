# RPN Radio UI Overhaul


Browsing Instagram on my account now floods me with several UI/UX tips and practices, making me inspired to update and retouch my apps with some latest trends in mobile designs.

# Old Look

Let's take a look at what the app looked like before the update:

<figure class="image">

<br/>

Though it looked intuitive - with just two simple steps: 1) Launch app, 2) Select station and Listen; the main page does not give the user context on what the app does, which raise this question:

**_What am I supposed to do?_**

## Menu List

At first glance of a first-time user, the stations list does NOT show that it is "clickable". So the first UI update was to change the 4x3 grid to a simple list.

<figure class="image">
<img src="/images/05-21/rpnradio-newui/menu-list-bna.png" alt="RPN Radio Stations" style="display: inline; width: 90%;">
<figcaption><em>Station Menu Item Before and After</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>

This subtle change provides the user a hint of "click me" by giving the list item a design of a button. It also gave a space for the station's detail to be added - station's location and live/offline status.

## Header and Controls

Ok, this area will look crammed especially on small-screen devices. Before this update though, I repositioned the buttons below the controls and were still crammed. This update allowed the horizontal list to be scrolled.

<figure class="image">

</figure>
<br/>

I also changed the text that shows the current stations into a simpler one and updated the share icon.

## New Font

I like [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins).

# About

Besides the UI updates mentioned above, I added an "About" page. It is a simple about and external links of RPN.

# Roadmap

These are my to-do list for the app, which we will see soon on future updates:

- No internet connection status
- Bottom player controls (Priority)
- App-aware sharing
- Rate and review prompt
- Links to station email/messaging

# Downloads

As always, the app is still available for Android and (REALLY) soon for iOS.
