            </div><p>Browsing Instagram on my account now floods me with several UI/UX tips and practices, making me inspired to update and retouch my apps with some latest trends in mobile designs.</p>
<h1 id="old-look">Old Look</h1>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at what the app looked like before the update:</p>
<figure class="image">


<figcaption><em>Old UI</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>Though it looked intuitive - with just two simple steps: 1) Launch app, 2) Select station and Listen; the main page does not give the user context on what the app does, which raise this question:</p>
<p><strong><em>What am I supposed to do?</em></strong></p>
<h2 id="menu-list">Menu List</h2>
<p>At first glance of a first-time user, the stations list does NOT show that it is &ldquo;clickable&rdquo;. So the first UI update was to change the 4x3 grid to a simple list.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Header & Controls Before and After</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>This subtle change provides the user a hint of &ldquo;click me&rdquo; by giving the list item a design of a button. It also gave a space for the station&rsquo;s detail to be added - station&rsquo;s location and live/offline status.</p>
<h2 id="header-and-controls">Header and Controls</h2>
<p>Ok, this area will look crammed especially on small-screen devices. Before this update though, I repositioned the buttons below the controls and were still crammed. This update allowed the horizontal list to be scrolled.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Menu Item Before and After</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>I also changed the text which shows the current stations into a simpler one and updated the share icon.</p>
<h2 id="new-font">New Font</h2>
<p>I like <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Poppins</a>.
<br></p>
<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>Besides the UI updates mentioned above, I added an &ldquo;About&rdquo; page. It is a simple about and external links of RPN.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>About page</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<h1 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h1>
<p>These are my to-do list for the app, which we will see soon on future updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>No internet connection status</li>
<li>Bottom player controls (Priority)</li>
<li>App-aware sharing</li>
<li>Rate and review prompt</li>
<li>Links to station email/messaging</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="downloads">Downloads</h1>
<p>As always, the app is still available for Android and (REALLY) soon for iOS.</p>
<p>Google Play Store: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rpnradio.radiov1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rpnradio.radiov1</a></p>
<p>Huawei App Gallery: <a href="https://appgallery.huawei.com/#/app/C103076031" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://appgallery.huawei.com/#/app/C103076031</a></p>

    <title>Flutter Coding</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/flutter-coding/</link>
    <pubDate>Mon, 15 Mar 2021 22:06:53 &#43;0800</pubDate>
    <author>Author</author>
    <guid>https://reddavid.me/flutter-coding/</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/feat/android-love-flutter.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>I&rsquo;ve heard about Flutter a long time ago but never actually used it or read in-depth about it. But I knew it was a UI framework from Google which uses a single code-base for mobile and web apps.</p>
<p>As you may know now, I developed some apps for Android and iOS using their native languages - Java and SwiftUI - and not a single-codebase language like Flutter. But I did try to code the RPN Radio app using Xamarin.Forms but the implementation of the Audio Players s*cks a$$ to be honest.</p>
<p>Coding with their native languages was just a personal challenge for me being tech-savvy and wanted to experiment and dive myself to their &ldquo;native world&rdquo;.</p>
<h1 id="android-and-bad-java-code">Android and Bad (Java) Code</h1>
<p>The Android Java code stuff was working - well, not that well - the implementation of the player was frequently bugged that it causes the app to crash. I tried several work arounds to the code to prevent the nasties, until I realized this is bad code.</p>
<p>To satisfy myself, and the users, I challenged myself to rebuild the app using Flutter.</p>
<p>Ever since March started, I started reading about Flutter and did some basic UI.</p>
<p>But first, let me tell you how I installed Flutter on Windows.</p>
<h1 id="pre-installation-pre-requisites">Pre-installation (Pre-requisites?)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have Git on your device. I installed Git for Windows</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve had Android Studio installed on my system ever since I coded for Android, which is also a recommended IDE for Flutter.</li>
<li>Some Android SDKs and;</li>
<li>Google Chrome browser.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<p>I pretty much followed the recommended guide as stated here: <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Install Flutter (Windows)</a>. But instead of  <code>C:\src\flutter</code>, I put it a level higher like this: <code>C:\flutter</code>.</p>
<p>Then added environment variable to Path. &lt;- This part is important if you want to run flutter commands in the command line</p>
<p>Ran <code>flutter doctor</code> until all requirements are check out</p>
<h1 id="ide-wait">IDE, wait&hellip;</h1>
<p>My IDE of choice is Android Studio, so I can use the emulators I already created and to avoid any additional setup when choosing another.</p>
<p>Upon opening the IDE, it was said that creating a new Flutter project should be there on the menu screen but it was missing!</p>
<p>Even though <code>flutter doctor</code> checked everything, I was disappointed that I can&rsquo;t start right away. Scraping the internet for solutions, I checked Android Studio&rsquo;s configuration and there, I downloaded some Flutter and Dart plugins which after a software restart, I can now create a new Flutter project.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>New Flutter Project</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>Since, the app I am planning to rebuild in Flutter is single-paged, it is a good starting-point to play around the Flutter widgets.</p>
<p>Coming from XAML, where everything seems &ldquo;as is&rdquo;, I am so uncomfortable about coding UI using script-like codes. But having started SwiftUI for a few weeks, I pretty much can stand it. ðŸ˜…</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Flutter UI Code</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<h1 id="beginning">Beginning</h1>
<p>Being the beginner, again, I am on my way to building to much more with Flutter with prettier code and nicer implementations.</p>
<p>I am now reading some books and watching some tutorials on YouTube to help me advance a little more each day.</p>
<p>Ever since  February began, I have been active to coding again. Learning new stuff that I do enjoy!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading my blog post, and will share some updates on how I would use Flutter sometime soon! Always take care peeps!</p>

    <title>Tune In RPN Radio Update</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/tunein-update/</link>
    <pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2021 20:30:09 &#43;0800</pubDate>
    <author>Author</author>
    <guid>https://reddavid.me/tunein-update/</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/feat/rpn-tunein.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>I updated the tune-in website for RPN. This post will detail the changes, what&rsquo;s new or removed, and how the update went.</p>
<h1 id="mainpage-and-mobile-first-design">MainPage and Mobile-First Design</h1>
<p>The main page remains got a few changes, starting with the font face and size. Before the update, the font family forced to check for <a href="https://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/proxima-nova" target="_blank">Proxima Nova</a> and fallback to Arial Nova or other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif" target="_blank">sans serif fonts.</a></p>
<p>Then I cleaned up my CSS file to make the whole website <a href="https://medium.com/@Vincentxia77/what-is-mobile-first-design-why-its-important-how-to-make-it-7d3cf2e29d00" target="_blank">&ldquo;mobile-first&rdquo;.</a>
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="now-playing-station-pages">Now Playing Station Pages</h1>
<p>The tune-in or now playing page received most of the update. I&rsquo;ve broken some of them below:</p>
<h2 id="back-button">Back Button</h2>
<p>The back button got a lot of love with some logic. At first, the button always takes you to the home (main) page with the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag attribute <code>href=&quot;/&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s got a javascript code that checks for an open navigation menu, and whether the history came from the tunein.rpnradio.com domain.</p>
<pre><code>function goBack() {
  if (isNavOpen) {
    closeNav();
  }
  else if (document.referrer == "") {
    window.location.href = "https://tunein.rpnradio.com/";
  }
  else {
    window.history.back();
  }
}; </code></pre>
<p>This logic was finalized when I opened a page link on my iPhone then the back button took me to the previous page - other site.</p>
<p>Now the back button takes you to home page when started with a station page.</p>
<h2 id="navigation-menu">Navigation Menu</h2>
<p>The station pages got a navigation menu that resembles the home page. This is to give the listener a continuous audio stream playback whilst needing to change a station.</p>
<p>Note: The navigation drawer will not work on browser back button - as I learned with other sites. The browser just simply go back to the previous page.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="security">Security</h1>
<p>The website was also SSL-enabled - <a href="https://www.websecurity.digicert.com/security-topics/https-everywhere" target="_blank">HTTPS Everywhere.</a></p>
<p>This also means that the old stream URLs will not work. Thankfully, the audio servers have secured stream URLs for secure websites.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="open-graph-metadata">Open Graph Metadata</h1>
<p>Social Media sites are the places where websites get the most referrers. So having metadata for them not just makes the website Facebook- or Twitter-friendly but it is a great addition to how it would look like when shared.</p>
<p>Making the images took waaaaay longer than I expected. I decided to add 3 mockup devices that shows the website on these devices. You can see the share preview below:</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Facebook Open Graph Preview</em></figcaption>
<br/>

<figcaption><em>Twitter Open Graph Preview</em></figcaption>
</figure>
Creating the metadata tags was made easy by using <a href="https://metatags.io/" target="_blank">Metatags.io</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
<h1 id="site-icons">Site Icons</h1>
<p>I went on to also update the website&rsquo;s favicons, to differentiate tunein to the news website. It now has the Android app icon below:</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><em>Website Favicon</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<h1 id="google-ads">Google Ads</h1>
<p>I replaced the part suggesting other methods to tunein (Zeno app, Radio Garden and our native Android app) with a Google Auto ad.</p>
<p>We all hate ads but this is the only modest way to profit for most websites.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="htaccess-to-remove-html">.htaccess to Remove .html</h1>
<p>I finally made it to work, shorten the address for site navigation. Instead of showing the full file name: <pre><small>tunein.rpnradio.com/batac.html</small></pre>
Some rules were added to the .htaccess file to make it <pre><small>tunein.rpnradio.com/batac</small></pre></p>
<p>.htaccess file:</p>
<pre><code>RewriteEngine On 
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off 
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]

RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} /([^.]+)\.html [NC]
RewriteRule ^ /%1 [NC,L,R]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}.html -f
RewriteRule ^ %{REQUEST_URI}.html [NC,L]
</code></pre>
<br/>
<h1 id="footer-finally">Footer Finally</h1>
<p>I added a subtle footer to the whole website. That&rsquo;s it. :)
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="final-words">Final Words</h1>
<p>This website is another medium for the company&rsquo;s aim for a greater reach by expanding to Digital Media. In addition to our native apps (which is available for Android - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rpnradio.radiov1&hl=en&gl=US" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a> and <a href="https://appgallery.huawei.com/#/app/C103076031" target="_blank">Huawei App Gallery</a>), the website also serves a means for our audiences to access our stations' broadcast anytime and anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>You can visit the website here: <a href="https://tunein./rpnradio.com/" target="_blank">Tune In â€” RPN Radio.</a></p>

                <img src="/images/feat/zipcodeph.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>Over these past few months, I have been checking on some fluent design concepts and app updates over Twitter and other design sites like, Dribbble, Behance, and even Medium.
Also, I have been busy gaming and doing some reading on my spare time that I missed coding and updating some of my apps.</p>
<p>Then one time, I just found the urge to update it after seeing Michael West&rsquo;s concept layouts over Dribbble. He created a UI concept for Windows 10&rsquo;s App settings panel as seen <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/6404804-Apps-features-Microsoft-Edge-style" target="_blank">here on his Dribbble post</a>.</p>
<p>I started coding at once, cleaning up some codes on the app beginning with the UI. And came up with the final layout.</p>
<p>Here are some screenshots of the updated app version 4.
</br></p>
