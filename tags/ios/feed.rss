      <description>Apple User -&amp;gt; Me Yes, I gave in to use an Apple device. Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried an iPhone XS before, and I must admit, having a device with software dedicated to its hardware is chef&amp;rsquo;s kiss. That&amp;rsquo;s what I liked about Apple, the hardware and software work along each other, and like most people, the price-tag for their phones held me back until December.
I loaned for an iPhone 11 since the iPhone 12 is expensive and I like the 11&amp;rsquo;s grip instead of the sharp edges of the new design.</description>
