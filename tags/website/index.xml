            </div><p>I updated the tune-in website for RPN. This post will detail the changes, what&rsquo;s new or removed, and how the update went.</p>
<h1 id="mainpage-and-mobile-first-design">MainPage and Mobile-First Design</h1>
<p>The main page remains got a few changes, starting with the font face and size. Before the update, the font family forced to check for <a href="https://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/proxima-nova" target="_blank">Proxima Nova</a> and fallback to Arial Nova or other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif" target="_blank">sans serif fonts.</a></p>
<p>Then I cleaned up my CSS file to make the whole website <a href="https://medium.com/@Vincentxia77/what-is-mobile-first-design-why-its-important-how-to-make-it-7d3cf2e29d00" target="_blank">&ldquo;mobile-first&rdquo;.</a>
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="now-playing-station-pages">Now Playing Station Pages</h1>
<p>The tune-in or now playing page received most of the update. I&rsquo;ve broken some of them below:</p>
<h2 id="back-button">Back Button</h2>
<p>The back button got a lot of love with some logic. At first, the button always takes you to the home (main) page with the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag attribute <code>href=&quot;/&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s got a javascript code that checks for an open navigation menu, and whether the history came from the tunein.rpnradio.com domain.</p>
<pre><code>function goBack() {
  if (isNavOpen) {
    closeNav();
  }
  else if (document.referrer == "") {
    window.location.href = "https://tunein.rpnradio.com/";
  }
  else {
    window.history.back();
  }
}; </code></pre>
<p>This logic was finalized when I opened a page link on my iPhone then the back button took me to the previous page - other site.</p>
<p>Now the back button takes you to home page when started with a station page.</p>
<h2 id="navigation-menu">Navigation Menu</h2>
<p>The station pages got a navigation menu that resembles the home page. This is to give the listener a continuous audio stream playback whilst needing to change a station.</p>
<p>Note: The navigation drawer will not work on browser back button - as I learned with other sites. The browser just simply go back to the previous page.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="security">Security</h1>
<p>The website was also SSL-enabled - <a href="https://www.websecurity.digicert.com/security-topics/https-everywhere" target="_blank">HTTPS Everywhere.</a></p>
<p>This also means that the old stream URLs will not work. Thankfully, the audio servers have secured stream URLs for secure websites.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="open-graph-metadata">Open Graph Metadata</h1>
<p>Social Media sites are the places where websites get the most referrers. So having metadata for them not just makes the website Facebook- or Twitter-friendly but it is a great addition to how it would look like when shared.</p>
<p>Making the images took waaaaay longer than I expected. I decided to add 3 mockup devices that shows the website on these devices. You can see the share preview below:</p>
<figure class="image">

<br/>

</figure>
Creating the metadata tags was made easy by using <a href="https://metatags.io/" target="_blank">Metatags.io</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
<h1 id="site-icons">Site Icons</h1>
<p>I went on to also update the website&rsquo;s favicons, to differentiate tunein to the news website. It now has the Android app icon below:</p>

<br/>
<h1 id="google-ads">Google Ads</h1>
<p>I replaced the part suggesting other methods to tunein (Zeno app, Radio Garden and our native Android app) with a Google Auto ad.</p>
<p>We all hate ads but this is the only modest way to profit for most websites.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="htaccess-to-remove-html">.htaccess to Remove .html</h1>
<p>I finally made it to work, shorten the address for site navigation. Instead of showing the full file name: <pre><small>tunein.rpnradio.com/batac.html</small></pre>
Some rules were added to the .htaccess file to make it <pre><small>tunein.rpnradio.com/batac</small></pre></p>
<p>.htaccess file:</p>
<pre><code>RewriteEngine On 
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off 
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]

RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} /([^.]+)\.html [NC]
RewriteRule ^ /%1 [NC,L,R]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}.html -f
RewriteRule ^ %{REQUEST_URI}.html [NC,L]
</code></pre>
<br/>
<h1 id="footer-finally">Footer Finally</h1>
<p>I added a subtle footer to the whole website. That&rsquo;s it. :)
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="final-words">Final Words</h1>
<p>This website is another medium for the company&rsquo;s aim for a greater reach by expanding to Digital Media. In addition to our native apps (which is available for Android - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rpnradio.radiov1&hl=en&gl=US" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a> and <a href="https://appgallery.huawei.com/#/app/C103076031" target="_blank">Huawei App Gallery</a>), the website also serves a means for our audiences to access our stations' broadcast anytime and anywhere in the world.</p>
