            </div><p>I just updated my OBS a few days ago with the official release version after trying out the several release candidates.</p>
<p>I will talk about the new features and improvements here that will be useful for my use. Check their blog post <a href="https://obsproject.com/blog/obs-studio-27-released" target="_blank">here</a> and the complete changelog <a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/27.0.0" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

</div>

<br>
<h1 id="undo--redo-5000">Undo &amp; Redo (5000)</h1>
<p>At last! No more annoyances when you just ACCIDENTALLY move something on the canvas. Undo and redo is here for every change you do in your sources and scenes - not sure for all filters though. And thatâ€™s 5000 actions.</p>
<p>Though I mostly use OBS for game streaming (no facecam), I move things around only to notice that it was not the source I wanted to move! This surely helps users out and always had been the most requested feature.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="files-where">Files, where?</h1>
<p>Version 27 also added a missing files window prompt on launch that allows us to relocate or ignore the missing files. Nice addition so we donâ€™t go start streaming only to have the files missing.</p>
<figure class="image">

<br/>
<h1 id="no-more-noise">No More Noise</h1>
<p>OBS v27 for Windows now adds NVIDIA Noise Removal as an option to audio Noise Suppression filter when the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-sdk/resources/" target="_blank">NVIDIA Audio Effects SDK</a> is installed. Oh, also you need an NVIDIA RTX GPU for that - so no screenshots from me.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="improvements">Improvements</h1>
<p>Thanks for these 2 new improvements among others:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browser Source interact button (toolbar)</li>
<li>Virtual Camera toggle button (system tray)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="fin">Fin</h1>
<p>This new version of OBS Studio definitely helps with the new added features. Now I want a selective record feature.</p>
<p>I use OBS Studio together with <a href="https://streamelements.com/" target="_blank">StreamElements</a> OBS Live to simplify my stream setup to Facebook Gaming. I now have 1,019 followers (as of this writing) and why not check me out there? Maybe talk about gaming, life, or programming? <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG/" target="_blank">RedDavidGG on Facebook Gaming</a></p>
<p>I dedicate the starwall page for my stars-sender. Thanks and make sure to check out OBS Studioâ€™s latest release <a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

    <title>Unlocked: 1K Followers</title>

            </div><p>First of all, thank you so much to all who stayed, watched, and enjoyed my content.</p>
<p>It was on May 26th that we finally got to a thousand following after a year of starting to be a Gaming Video Creator on Facebook. The stream felt like another day of chill streaming by playing a couple of hours of Minecraft. It was quite overwhelming for a small-time (and not full-time) streamer like me but thanks to my cousins and og supporters for helping me out in the chat and Discord server.</p>
<figure class="image">

<br/>
<h1 id="strikedailystrike-nightly-streams"><strike>Daily</strike> Nightly Streams</h1>
<p>Now that there&rsquo;s that 1K following behind me, I will pursue to stream on a daily basis, even a short one because honestly, I miss talking and updating with them. I will also continue to improve my stream quality.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="not-minecraft-hello">Not Minecraft, Hello?</h1>
<p>Minecraft is a really popular game we all know that, and most of my followers were because of the game. I do not expect everyone to like me playing variety of games but I still hope most could support me when I come back playing other types of games. Although, I would still join our SMP server if I fail to stream Minecraft.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="twitchyoutube-switch">Twitch/YouTube Switch</h1>
<p>Yes, I have been thinking of switching to either one, why? First, Twitch have several audience interaction which I have been using when I watch my favorite streamers there like, watch points, play with viewers, etc and you can watch on app minimized.</p>
<figure class="image">

</figure>
<br/>
<p>While YouTube had a better chat system, but chat highlights and audience interactions are better - with chatbots.</p>
<p>I held back these thoughts before since I did start my Facebook page a long time and gained a few followers. I just hoped if I made up my mind to switch, we can determine the real supporters. Maybe?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for this blog post. Thank you again for visiting my website and you can catch up on my Gaming Videos on <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook Gaming</a> and follower me there. You can also follow me on my socials: @reddvid</p>

    <title>Finally! Logitech C922</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/the-logitech-c922/</link>
    <pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 23:17:51 &#43;0800</pubDate><dc:creator>David</dc:creator><guid>https://reddavid.me/the-logitech-c922/</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/feat/logitech-c922.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>Yoo! I finally got the C922 PRO HD Webcam from Logitech after wishing having it for years.</p>
<p>Honestly, I bought the camera in a slightly higher price due to the model being out of stock in major stores and just got from a &ldquo;hoarder&rdquo; in Facebook marketplace. :) Harsh but true.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get into my short blog/review/impression about this industry-standard in semi-professional streaming.</p>
<br/>
<h1 id="wait">Wait</h1>
<p>You might ask, why only now? At first, I never really thought of having a good webcam as a small streamer, and I also have this app on my Android phone which makes my Nokia 7 Plus pose as a webcam. Then, I wanted the camera to be positioned well, so I bought a cheaper Logitech, the C270.</p>
<figure class="image">

  <figcaption><em>Logitech C270 Webcam</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>The C270 suited my needs - stream just now and then, and it&rsquo;s just right for video calls and conferencing. The only problem with this one is it has a bad exposure. I used the C270 for almost 3 months until I got the money to buy the beast of a camera, that is the C922.</p>
<br/>
<h1 id="lets-see-922-it">Let&rsquo;s See (922) It</h1>
<p>I opened a brand new Logitech C922 way way before but it wasn&rsquo;t mine, so I already know the contents (alibi for not having pictures after unboxing ðŸ˜‚). And I also tried the unit itself so I knew the quality it brings.</p>
<p>The box contains the C922 camera, a table-top tripod, manuals and a sheet containing the free 3-month XSplit Premium codes (Again, sorry for not having pictures).</p>
<figure class="image">

  <figcaption><em>Logitech C922 Box</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<h1 id="quick-marketing-specs">Quick (marketing) specs</h1>
<p>I won&rsquo;t dive deep into the webcam&rsquo;s specifications like weight and dimensions but here are the common &ldquo;marketing&rdquo; specs that will actually make you consider buying one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capture 1080p @ 30fps, or</li>
<li>720p @ 60fps</li>
<li>Auto focus</li>
<li>Wide Field of View</li>
<li>Advanced camera software</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h1 id="ha-mountable">Ha! Mountable</h1>
<p>The C922 has a screw hole for mounting onto a tripod. The tripod can be extended up to 18.5cm. Here&rsquo;s the closed tripod in three max lengths (with regards to the feet extensions).</p>
<figure class="image">

</figure>
<br/>
<p>The C922 also has a built-in microphone but most people, including me, advice to use an external mic instead.</p>
<br/>
<h1 id="logitech-capture">Logitech Capture</h1>
<p>Upon connecting the webcam to my PC, Logitech prompted to install the companion software - Logitech Capture. The software is advanced enough for my needs - I can zoom and pan, flip the captured video horizontally and/or vertically, choose to prefer exposure or framerate, and most importantly the capture resolutions.</p>
<figure class="image">

  <figcaption><em>Logitech Capture Software</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>The software provides templates for typical sizes: FHD, 720p, and 360p; Portrait: 1080x1920, 720x1280, 360x640; and Squares: 1080x1080, 720x720, and 360x360.</p>
<figure class="image">

  <figcaption><em>Logitech Capture Software - Resolution Options</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>The software also allows you to add effects, text, etc with the Effects menu: Watermark, Text Overlay, Scene effects, Color borders, and Transitions for 2 scenes.</p>
<figure class="image">

</figure>
<br/>
<h1 id="minor-issues">Minor Issues</h1>
<p>There are a couple of issues for me, the first one really makes me annoyed is that I cannot turn off the hotkeys for the software and I have a frameless monitor which mounting the camera is a pain in the a$$ to keep it from covering up the display - even for just a centimeter.</p>
<figure class="image">

<br/>
<h1 id="its-great">It&rsquo;s Great!</h1>
<p>Overall, I am happy with the C922 webcam - my loved ones can see me clearly during video calls. And I thank everybody for supporting me on my <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG/" target="_blank">stream</a>, visiting my website, and checking my Windows 10 apps.</p>

<p>To finish this blog post, let&rsquo;s all stay safe during the pandemic - and even after the pandemic.</p>
