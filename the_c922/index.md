# Finally! Logitech C922




Yoo! I finally got the C922 PRO HD Webcam from Logitech after wishing having it for years.

Honestly, I bought the camera in a slightly higher price due to the model being out of stock in major stores and just got from a "hoarder" in Facebook marketplace. :) Harsh but true.

Let's get into my short blog/review/impression about this industry-standard in semi-professional streaming.

<br/>

# Wait

You might ask, why only now? At first, I never really thought of having a good webcam as a small streamer, and I also have this app on my Android phone which makes my Nokia 7 Plus pose as a webcam. Then, I wanted the camera to be positioned well, so I bought a cheaper Logitech, the C270.

<br/>

The C270 suited my needs - stream just now and then, and it's just right for video calls and conferencing. The only problem with the one is it has a bad exposure. I used the C270 for almost 3 months until I got the money to buy this beast of a camera.

# Let's See (922) It

I opened a brand new Logitech C922 way way before but it wasn't mine, so I already know the contents (alibi for not having pictures after unboxing ðŸ˜‚). And I also tried the unit itself so I knew the quality it brings. 

The box contains the C922 camera, a table-top tripod, manuals and a sheet containing the free 3-month XSplit Premium codes (Again, sorry for not having pictures).

# Quick (marketing) specs

I won't dive deep into the webcam's specifications like weight and dimensions but here are the common "marketing" specs that will actually make you consider buying one:
- Capture 1080p @ 30fps, or
- 720p @ 60fps
- Auto focus 
- Wide Field of View
- Advanced camera software

<br/>

# Ha! Mountable

The C922 has a screw hole for mounting onto a tripod. The tripod can be extended up to 18.5cm. Here's the closed tripod in three max lengths (with regards to the feet extensions).

The C922 also has a built-in microphone but most people, including me, advice to use an external mic instead.

# Logitech Capture

Upon connecting the webcam to my PC, Logitech prompted to install the companion software - Logitech Capture. The software is advanced enough for my needs - I can zoom and pan, flip the captured video horizontally and/or vertically, choose to prefer exposure or framerate, and most importantly the capture resolutions.

<br/>

The software provides templates for typical sizes: FHD, 720p, and 360p; Portrait: 1080x1920, 720x1280, 360x640; and Squares: 1080x1080, 720x720, and 360x360.

The software also allows you to add effects, text, etc with the Effects menu: Watermark, Text Overlay, Scene effects, Color borders, and Transitions for 2 scenes.

# Minor Issues

There are a couple of issues for me, the first one really makes me annoyed is that I cannot turn off the hotkeys for the software and I have a frameless monitor which mounting the camera is a pain in the a$$ to keep it from covering up the display - even for just a centimeter.

# It's Great!
Overall, I am happy with the C922 webcam - my loved ones can see me clearly during video calls. And I thank everybody for supporting me on my <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG/" target="_blank">stream</a>, visiting my website, and checking my Windows 10 apps.
