            </div><p>Here we go again folks! Another PC upgrade, this time we take our storage to the next level.</p>
<h1 id="top-player">Top Player</h1>
<p>I just bought a Samsung 970 EVO Plus, 1TB for my &ldquo;coding needs&rdquo;. I recently experience a throttle while using my current XPG 500GB - I have been using some Virtual Machines lately to test out some things, and the SSD space gets loaded up quickly.</p>
<p>The SSD costs me around US$100 and failed to get a cheaper one since I am not paying the whole price - again, I got this for credit. ðŸ˜…</p>
<h1 id="samsung-why">Samsung, why?</h1>
<p>Samsung has been the top brand for SSDs and I can say this myself since personally, I used an 860 EVO in the past for my laptop. And even though my current XPG SSD does it&rsquo;s job, I needed an storage upgrade and it&rsquo;s time to get this one.</p>
<p>The technical specs and comparison is available in the internet which you can visit on PCWorld, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3334876/samsung-970-evo-plus-review-samsungs-entry-level-nvme-ssd-is-faster-and-cheaper.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung 970 EVO Plus review</a></p>
<h1 id="take-a-look">Take a Look</h1>
<p>I forgot to take pictures to avoid the SSD from picking up some static from my desk mat. But I did take a picture of the box before installing it on the system.</p>

<p>This is not to flaunt the things I have, I&rsquo;m just trying to share my thoughts and share which can help my daily activities like coding, and file and graphics processing.</p>
