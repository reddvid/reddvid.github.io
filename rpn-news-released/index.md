# RPN News Mobile App Released


It's been a while again since my last post but there were no significant updates lately - besides another week-long vacation. So let me introduce this new mobile app from RPN that I developed and releasing now.

# Delays

The app had a working beta for Android devices for awhile now with bare experience and a better update has been in the works. I took the time to work out the database functions, UI and UX, and some other features (mobile ads, and customized links).

I apologize for the delay but I just made sure these features are working for production.

# App Details

Most brands nowadays accompany their line of business with a mobile app, beside the [RPN Radio app](https://tunein.rpnradio.com/download) which was released so much earlier, I am now finally be able to bring news mobile app for Android devices, and iPhones.

Right now, the app is a feed for the provincial news as visible on [RPN website](https://rpnradio.com/category/provincial-news/). The news are gathered by our provincial/regional news stations that you can read from the website or from the app - for much easier reading and sharing.

# Screenshots

It took too long to release the app that the version is now at 2.1. Below are screenshots (store previews for iPhone and Android).
