<h1 style="text-align: center;">About Me</h1>

Hi! I am David. I am an electronics engineer and a software programmer.

I manage and admin website and other digital media (e.g. live stream, social media, cPanel).

I develop desktop and mobile applications using XAML/C# and Flutter/Dart. I also know a little bit of bare HTML/CSS/JS.

## Background

I started coding in college for our project study, RFID Gate System. We used Forms and VB.Net for the software and C++ for the Arduino controller. I then got into Windows Phone App development and learned C#, XAML, and Git. The first apps I developed were mostly for personal-use until I registered and submitted one to the Windows Phone Store.

Then I started coding apps which helped me simplify the jobs I do - from monitoring and reporting data and statistics to automating web interactions. What started as a hobby became a small source of income. I have more than a dozen apps available right now in the Windows 10 Store.

And right now, I am learning web development and looking forward to get a Microsoft Certification.

## Bio

Live until 21 in a small town in Pangasinan.

I can speak Filipino (Tagalog), and English (spoken: 8, written: 9). I can also speak in my local dialect, Pangasinan.

I graduated and licensed as Electronics Engineer on 2013.
