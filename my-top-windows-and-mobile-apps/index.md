# My Top Apps for Windows and iPhone


As you may know by now, I am an electronics engineer but currently and mostly doing IT stuff and some casual gaming. I can also describe myself as an on-a-budget tech enthusiast - I buy top-tier pc/laptop upgrades after some time since their release or when it's affordable enough; like when I went for 1TB Samsung 970 EVO just to hold the apps, games, and files that I leave after testing them out.

Having said that, I sometimes stumble upon bad or corrupted files, deleted some system files, OR EVEN installing Windows sh\*ttiest Insider builds. But I seldom hold myself back reverting or reinstalling Windows to clean everything up.

## Cloud works

I trust the cloud, at least with Microsoft's OneDrive service. I have a 1TB subscription with them to hold my most important files (like assets for this website, etc.) and pictures. I also always keep in hand a Windows installer on a USB stick. With all the files are backed up I simply begin reformatting it and reinstall apps/softwares starting with these:

# Windows Apps

This list may or may not be in order.

## Avast Driver Updater

Since Windows 10, the OS also installs drivers but I make sure they are updated using this software. It has a free trial and it works just fine. At this time, I also install graphics drivers (AMD Radeon Software or NVidia GeForce Experience).

## Microsoft Office

My subscription also contains a license to use full desktop version of Microsoft Office so it's a win-win for me since this is an important skill? personally and for work.

## Steam

Additionally, I don't store my games to where my OS is installed. Steam and most game platforms allows us to locate game files, so I don't have to redownload hundreds of GB game files.

## Bitwarden

Ever since I experienced being hacked, I immediately started using a password manager/generator to make my passwords not the same - YES what a shame.

## WinRAR

Compress and extract files and folders with unlimited 40 day trial.

## Spotify

Even though the lack of lossless audio format, Spotify is my go-to music service. Unless it came preinstalled with Windows.

## VoiceMeeter Banana

One of the most useful audio mixer I use. I allows to mix and manage audio inputs and outputs to use for other communication apps.

## Visual Studio Code

I use this as code editor for Flutter/Dart mobile development and other source codes like this blog.

**Download link: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)**

## Visual Studio

The full IDE software for various development cases. I mainly use it for Windows app development as I haven't got into webapps as of now. I code and create apps using WinForms, WPF, and UWP (WinUI). I also tried Xamarin.Forms but I moved onto Flutter for cross-platform mobile app development.

## OBS Studio

I used this for streaming, recording and virtual camera purposes. I now use OBS instead of XSplit. The software is FREE and much lightweight. It also has features and other free plugins made by the community.

## Figma

This free app is browser-based but can also be downloaded as a desktop app. It was made for designers to build UI/UX interfaces - which I sometimes do when making apps. I also use this to make a quick and simple logos and other graphics.

Now on to mobile apps. I switched to iPhone nearly a year ago because of the hardware-and-software stability (in my opinion) and the support does not end after 2 or 3 years, unlike Android. So resetting my device (after a really really bad beta software) isn't that much of a hassle because of iCloud backups.

# Mobile Apps

Here are my top apps that I use on a daily basis. I will not put the specific store page instead I will link to their website for mobile downloads (if available). I'll list the apps I use on both platforms (PC and Mobile)

## Spotify

## Bitwarden

### Steam Mobile

## Microsoft Office, Outlook, and OneDrive

I put them together here since they are not in a suite but the new Office app user-wise deprecated the standalone Word, Excel, and PowerPoint apps since you can view and edit your documents in one app.

## Twitter

Where I get updated to what's happening. I only follow niche and some well-known "wholesome and awesome" Twitter users.

**Download link: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/settings/download?lang=en)**

## Facebook Messenger

Yup, most family members and friends are into messenger chats so that's no escaping Facebook.

## GCash

Globe Telecom's virtual wallet now available for all networks.

## YouTube and Reddit

My other ways to consume content.

## Microsoft Edge

Despite the sync being subpar to Google Chrome, I prefer this one as my main browser on my iPhone.

**Download link: [Microsoft Edge Web Browser](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge#platform)**

## Shopee

Every once in a while (trust me ðŸ¤£) we just want to shop online. I recently deleted my Lazada account because it annoyed me so much with their shenanigans - which I am not really sure.
