            </div><p>The year 2020 has been tough for most of us but people slowly caught up and jumped right into live streaming or content creation. Facebook Gaming is one of them, it&rsquo;s like Twitch or YouTube Gaming but Facebook.</p>
<h1 id="my-journey-begins">My Journey Begins</h1>
<p>I started my Facebook Page waaaay back 2014 and started as a Page for my published apps on Microsoft store. I posted links and some promotional images, some updates about developing them, and other simple stuff.</p>
<p>I always have been a fan of PC-gaming since my high school years but with slow or lack thereof internet connectivity - I didn&rsquo;t stream all of my gaming journey of someone else to see.</p>
<p>With the start of the lockdown on March 2020, I decided to convert my Facebook Page from a Personal Blog to be a Gaming Video Creator category. Then I proceeded to live stream my gameplays of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/362890/Black_Mesa/" target="_blank">Blackmesa</a>, a fan-made rework of the infamous Half-Life game into the Source Engine. Of course, the struggle to gain viewers and followers is real - even to this day.</p>
<p>Being a casual streamer, I didn&rsquo;t have a regular schedule to build a following and this, for me is still a personal choice to <em>share</em> my gameplays to the public.</p>
<p>As time goes by, some viewers come and go, and some leave a comment for me to at least respond, and that brings additional life to my live stream. That&rsquo;s when I realized, I like someone to talk to every now and then.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="stars">Stars</h1>
<p>Being paid for content creation goes way back since YouTube, and now most platforms integrate some <em>monetization</em> to gain more users. This is where Facebook Stars come, I will just post this link on what and how Stars work on Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/903272529876480?id=648321075955172" target="_blank">About Facebook Stars</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not simple to be eligible to get stars, Facebook has a criteria for a Creator to be enabled. Firstly, make your Page category as Gaming Video Creator, have at least 100 followers, stream games on at least 2 days in one consecutive 14-day period, and stream games for at least 4 hours within the same 14-day period.</p>
<p>Even though my page old as f*ck, I only managed to grow it to only 380-ish, thankfully enough to check another one out of the criteria.</p>
<p>Streaming at least 4 hours is easy-peasy, I can do that within a day. So that&rsquo;s <strike>three</strike> four out of four criteria checked out.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="stars-please">Stars, please!</h1>
<p>That went easy, now I can have all the stars in the world. Wait, my current audience/followers were from the past!</p>
<p>My eligibility was just to enable the stars, it is still up to the community to watch me and send me their stars. Now time to gain some followers.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="growth">Growth</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ll admit, I am an introvert, I don&rsquo;t show or provide content as easily as others do. Whenever I post some creative works, it&rsquo;s a final product or just me behind the camera.</p>
<p>So growth is a problem, I tend to watch some helpful videos to find a solution to my problem: &ldquo;How to grow when you are camera-shy&rdquo; or &ldquo;How to engage an audience when you&rsquo;re not a conversationalist&rdquo;, something like those.</p>
<p>During these process, I stopped streaming until June 2020, where I (we all) had to adjust with the pandemic - work and life changes. I started by boosting my Facebook page with an ad while I stream quite regularly for a couple of hours each day.</p>
<p>For months, without a proper schedule, I am thankful to gain the followers I have now.</p>

<h1 id="mining-and-crafting-fps-and-story-modes">Mining and Crafting, FPS and Story-Modes</h1>
<p>I also started to play Minecraft again and rented a server for my survival multiplayer world - invited some of my friends to come and play. This also ticked my followers count a notch since Minecraft is a game everyone loved to play - even loved to watch! THen slowly invited some viewers to join over the months.</p>
<p>I would just want my followers (LODI&rsquo;s) to know that I play a variety of games so if ever you catch me playing another game besides Minecraft, I hope you&rsquo;d still watch me and let&rsquo;s all enjoy my niche of games. I streamed Apex Legends most of January 2021 since I find it enjoyable, Call of Duty: Mobile when playing together with my old friends, other old triple AAA games like the Far Cry series (which I can&rsquo;t afford to pay at launch), and my long-time favorite - Left 4 Dead 2.</p>

<h1 id="a-thousand-thanks">A &lsquo;Thousand&rsquo; Thanks</h1>
<p>I am now reaching a thousand (954 as of writing) slowly but surely. Reaching a follower with a letter in it (1&rsquo;K', that is) means so much to me, and achieving this will just be the start of something grander and more enjoyable to the stream.</p>
<p>As a coder, I found a way to thank my stars-sender by making a page here in my website to list their names which I called <a href="/starwall">Starwall</a>.

    <title>Logitech G304 Review</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/g304-review/</link>

                <img src="/images/feat/g304.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>So this is my short and honest review of the G304 wireless mouse.</p>
<p>As I mentioned on my previous blog post <a href="/story-of-owning-logitech-mice/">here</a>, this is my 4th mouse and my first gaming? wireless mouse. I ordered it online from DataBlitz for $39, and was delivered quickly in 2 days.</p>
<br/>
<h1 id="whats-in-the-box">What&rsquo;s in the box?</h1>
<p>The box contains the wireless mouse itself, the usual manuals, Logitech Gaming promo leaflet, a blue G logo sticker, a Duracell AA battery, and a USB extension cord.</p>

<br/>
<h1 id="lets-get-physical">Let&rsquo;s get Physical!</h1>
<p>The mouse has no RGB strip like it&rsquo;s cousins (G Pro/G203) but it has a single RGB LED that indicates colored DPI assignments in Logitech G Hub. The battery compartment and the USB receiver is accessed through the lower top part of the mouse - by sliding it off the body.</p>

<p>I currently use an Energizer Lithium AA battery which I believe is lighter but I still keep the free battery whenever I need a heavier setup.</p>

<p>The power switch is located below the mouse with a red and blue color indicator for off and on state. The bottom also has an extra slide compared to the G Pro/G203.</p>

<p>The mouse shape fits perfectly in my hands and I can switch to the wired G Pro when I play some competitive games - not that this can&rsquo;t do the job. But I often stick to this, G304, every time I stream my games (shameless plug - <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG/">https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG/</a>)</p>
 

<br/>
<h1 id="reliability">Reliability</h1>
<p>I used this since day one - June 2 - and I only got a hiccup once during a Dota 2 game which made me switch to wired, and since then I used this as a daily driver and on my games. Lately, I am playing Minecraft a lot, some Dota 2, CS:GO, some Valorant, Metro Exodus, just finished Mafia II: Definitive Edition, C&amp;C Yuri&rsquo;s Revenge.</p>
<br/>
<h1 id="verdict-at-last">Verdict, at last</h1>
<p>My overall experience using the same shape of a mouse will be just comfortable throughout my day - office job and being a small-time streamer. It also frees your hand positions by not limited by a wired mouse. Despite it not having an RGB, I would suggest this for small-handed people, for those who travel a lot and for gamers and streamers looking for a budget wireless gaming mouse.</p>
<br/>
<h1 id="more-info">More info?</h1>
<p>Since I don&rsquo;t have a weighing scale and sea of tech reviews, you can check the thorough tech specs review from Rocket Jump Ninja <a href="https://www.rocketjumpninja.com/products/mouse/logitech-g305" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
