            </div><p>I just updated my OBS a few days ago with the official release version after trying out the several release candidates.</p>
<p>I will talk about the new features and improvements here that will be useful for my use. Check their blog post <a href="https://obsproject.com/blog/obs-studio-27-released" target="_blank">here</a> and the complete changelog <a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/27.0.0" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

<h1 id="undo--redo-5000">Undo &amp; Redo (5000)</h1>
<p>At last! No more annoyances when you just ACCIDENTALLY move something on the canvas. Undo and redo is here for every change you do in your sources and scenes - not sure for all filters though. And that’s 5000 actions.</p>
<p>Though I mostly use OBS for game streaming (no facecam), I move things around only to notice that it was not the source I wanted to move! This surely helps users out and always had been the most requested feature.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="files-where">Files, where?</h1>
<p>Version 27 also added a missing files window prompt on launch that allows us to relocate or ignore the missing files. Nice addition so we don’t go start streaming only to have the files missing.</p>

<h1 id="no-more-noise">No More Noise</h1>
<p>OBS v27 for Windows now adds NVIDIA Noise Removal as an option to audio Noise Suppression filter when the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-sdk/resources/" target="_blank">NVIDIA Audio Effects SDK</a> is installed. Oh, also you need an NVIDIA RTX GPU for that - so no screenshots from me.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="improvements">Improvements</h1>
<p>Thanks for these 2 new improvements among others:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browser Source interact button (toolbar)</li>
<li>Virtual Camera toggle button (system tray)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="fin">Fin</h1>
<p>This new version of OBS Studio definitely helps with the new added features. Now I want a selective record feature.</p>
<p>I use OBS Studio together with <a href="https://streamelements.com/" target="_blank">StreamElements</a> OBS Live to simplify my stream setup to Facebook Gaming. I now have 1,019 followers (as of this writing) and why not check me out there? Maybe talk about gaming, life, or programming? <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG/" target="_blank">RedDavidGG on Facebook Gaming</a></p>
<p>I dedicate the starwall page for my stars-sender. Thanks and make sure to check out OBS Studio’s latest release <a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
