It’s been a while again since my last post but there were no significant updates lately - besides another week-long vacation. So let me introduce this new mobile app from RPN that I developed and releasing now. Delays The app had a working beta for Android devices for awhile now with bare experience and a better update has been in the works. I took the time to work out the database functions, UI and UX, and some other features (mobile ads, and customized links). I apologize for the delay but I just made sure these features are working for production. App Details Most brands nowadays accompany their line of business with a mobile app, beside the RPN Radio app which was released so much earlier, I am now finally be able to bring news mobile app for Android devices, and iPhones. Right now, the app is a feed for the provincial news as visible on RPN website. The news are gathered by our provincial/regional news stations that you can read from the website or from the app - for much easier reading and sharing.

There’s just nothing to share, I don’t know. But here are some highlights these past 2 months (may or may not be in particular order): Sleeping earlier. Visiting the province means that you MUST sleep early. Can’t do much when waking later in the day. Cook my own food.

I can’t remember where I found The War of Art (yes, not Art of War). It is a book about fighting resistance of doing art (a metaphor of doing what you REALLY love). It’s a short self-development book authored by Steven Pressfield, and later I found that it has sequels or whatever you call it: Do The Work and Turning Pro. Do The Work was originally published first but was updated (I think?) to be the follow-up of TWoA. As the book title says, when overcoming resistance DO THE WORK. Lastly, Turning Pro is about escaping the amateur life (of doing work). I also stumbled upon a website called mostrecommendedbooks.com, a website where you can find a list of books which top personalities and celebrities had read. Some notable personalities I leisurely checked: Barack Obama, Bill Gates, Elon Musk (this man is futuristic and really into tech!), Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, PewDiePie, Richard Branson, and Steve Jobs. They all have their niche but I found that they have some mutual titles which I got interested putting into my reading list: Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl (finished as of this writing) Mindset by Dr. Carol Dweck Factfulness by Hans Rosling Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker Measure What Matters by John Doerr Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell Algorithms to Live By by Brian Christian \u0026 Tom Griffiths Educated by Tara Westover Zero to One by Peter Thiel I recommend reading “Man’s Search for Meaning” at least once in your life. 🙂 Man's Search for Meaning cover Online Courses.

I was so looking forward to at least visit a beach, see a sunset, feel the breeze of fresh air but UNLUCKILY the weather ahead was not well! I did not see the predictions that there will be a coming storm for the week. So the first few days were a bust, and I just stayed inside and chilled out with some beer. The 20th was a holiday, and magically the weather was at least fine for us to go to Binmaley beach - don’t worry, there were no crowds so we can be safe, I think?

Lightning to AV Adapter and USB Capture Card I wonder why branded capture cards are so damn expensive?! Like the Elgato HD60S and AverMedia Live Gamer Ultra.

This also means that I am back to relieving some stress thru my beloved game Minecraft, (Survival Mode). First World? The first server I rented became toxic unenjoyable after a few months after opening it into the public - NO it’s not because of the new players, but because the server was technically “DONE” by having usable XP farms, stripped mines, food source, and other auto AFK farms. Which meant that new players have nothing more to do but mess around most of the time. I tried to reload the server with a new world but it kept corrupting upto the point that I reverted it back to the older (toxic) world. And I stopped playing less and less. Refreshed and New? SEASON TWO Yes, after I decided to stream again, I hastily rented a new server and invite some of my OG followers to play with me. As of now, the world is still peaceful and managed to invite more players in hoping we can live happily in the upcoming days.

But I knew it was a UI framework from Google which uses a single code-base for mobile and web apps. As you may know now, I developed some apps for Android and iOS using their native languages - Java and SwiftUI - and not a single-codebase language like Flutter. But I did try to code the RPN Radio app using Xamarin.Forms but the implementation of the Audio Players s*cks a$$ to be honest. Coding with their native languages was just a personal challenge for me being tech-savvy and wanted to experiment and dive myself to their “native world”. Android and Bad (Java) Code The Android Java code stuff was working - well, not that well - the implementation of the player was frequently bugged that it causes the app to crash. I tried several work arounds to the code to prevent the nasties, until I realized this is bad code. To satisfy myself, and the users, I challenged myself to rebuild the app using Flutter. Ever since March started, I started reading about Flutter and did some basic UI. But first, let me tell you how I installed Flutter on Windows. Pre-installation (Pre-requisites?) Make sure you have Git on your device. I installed Git for Windows I’ve had Android Studio installed on my system ever since I coded for Android, which is also a recommended IDE for Flutter. Some Android SDKs and; Google Chrome browser. Installation I pretty much followed the recommended guide as stated here: Install Flutter (Windows). But instead of C:\\src\\flutter, I put it a level higher like this: C:\\flutter. Then added environment variable to Path. \u003c- This part is important if you want to run flutter commands in the command line Ran flutter doctor until all requirements are check out IDE, wait… My IDE of choice is Android Studio, so I can use the emulators I already created and to avoid any additional setup when choosing another. Upon opening the IDE, it was said that creating a new Flutter project should be there on the menu screen but it was missing! Even though flutter doctor checked everything, I was disappointed that I can’t start right away. Scraping the internet for solutions, I checked Android Studio’s configuration and there, I downloaded some Flutter and Dart plugins which after a software restart, I can now create a new Flutter project. New Flutter Project\r\r\rSince, the app I am planning to rebuild in Flutter is single-paged, it is a good starting-point to play around the Flutter widgets. Coming from XAML, where everything seems “as is”, I am so uncomfortable about coding UI using script-like codes. But having started SwiftUI for a few weeks, I pretty much can stand it. 😅 Flutter UI Code\r\r\rBeginning Being the beginner, again, I am on my way to building to much more with Flutter with prettier code and nicer implementations. I am now reading some books and watching some tutorials on YouTube to help me advance a little more each day. Ever since February began, I have been active to coding again. Learning new stuff that I do enjoy! Thanks for reading my blog post, and will share some updates on how I would use Flutter sometime soon! Always take care peeps!

Thankfully, the audio servers have secured stream URLs for secure websites. Open Graph Metadata Social Media sites are the places where websites get the most referrers. So having metadata for them not just makes the website Facebook- or Twitter-friendly but it is a great addition to how it would look like when shared. Making the images took waaaaay longer than I expected. I decided to add 3 mockup devices that shows the website on these devices. You can see the share preview below: Facebook Open Graph Preview\r\rTwitter Open Graph Preview\r\rCreating the metadata tags was made easy by using Metatags.io.\r\r\rSite Icons I went on to also update the website’s favicons, to differentiate tunein to the news website.

We all hate ads but this is the only modest way to profit for most websites. .htaccess to Remove .html I finally made it to work, shorten the address for site navigation. Instead of showing the full file name: tunein.rpnradio.com/batac.html Some rules were added to the .htaccess file to make it tunein.rpnradio.com/batac .htaccess file: RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]\rRewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} /([^.]+)\\.html [NC]\rRewriteRule ^ /%1 [NC,L,R]\rRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}.html -f\rRewriteRule ^ %{REQUEST_URI}.html [NC,L]\r\r\rFooter Finally I added a subtle footer to the whole website.

I loaned for an iPhone 11 since the iPhone 12 is expensive and I like the 11’s grip instead of the sharp edges of the new design. I got a yellow one since the black sold out.

I finally got the C922 PRO HD Webcam from Logitech after wishing having it for years. Honestly, I bought the camera in a slightly higher price due to the model being out of stock in major stores and just got from a “hoarder” in Facebook marketplace. :) Harsh but true. Let’s get into my short blog/review/impression about this industry-standard in semi-professional streaming. \rWait You might ask, why only now? At first, I never really thought of having a good webcam as a small streamer, and I also have this app on my Android phone which makes my Nokia 7 Plus pose as a webcam. Then, I wanted the camera to be positioned well, so I bought a cheaper Logitech, the C270. Logitech C270 Webcam\r\r\rThe C270 suited my needs - stream just now and then, and it’s just right for video calls and conferencing. The only problem with this one is it has a bad exposure. I used the C270 for almost 3 months until I got the money to buy the beast of a camera, that is the C922. \rLet’s See (922) It I opened a brand new Logitech C922 way way before but it wasn’t mine, so I already know the contents (alibi for not having pictures after unboxing 😂). And I also tried the unit itself so I knew the quality it brings. The box contains the C922 camera, a table-top tripod, manuals and a sheet containing the free 3-month XSplit Premium codes (Again, sorry for not having pictures). Logitech C922 Box\r\r\rQuick (marketing) specs I won’t dive deep into the webcam’s specifications like weight and dimensions but here are the common “marketing” specs that will actually make you consider buying one: Capture 1080p @ 30fps, or 720p @ 60fps Auto focus Wide Field of View Advanced camera software \rHa! Mountable The C922 has a screw hole for mounting onto a tripod. The tripod can be extended up to 18.5cm. Here’s the closed tripod in three max lengths (with regards to the feet extensions). Logitech C922 Tripod Screw Hole and Lengths\r\r\rThe tripod, without and with the webcam. Logitech C922 Tripod\r\r\rThe C922 also has a built-in microphone but most people, including me, advice to use an external mic instead. \rLogitech Capture Upon connecting the webcam to my PC, Logitech prompted to install the companion software - Logitech Capture. The software is advanced enough for my needs - I can zoom and pan, flip the captured video horizontally and/or vertically, choose to prefer exposure or framerate, and most importantly the capture resolutions. Logitech Capture Software\r\r\rThe software provides templates for typical sizes: FHD, 720p, and 360p; Portrait: 1080x1920, 720x1280, 360x640; and Squares: 1080x1080, 720x720, and 360x360. Logitech Capture Software - Resolution Options\r\r\rThe software also allows you to add effects, text, etc with the Effects menu: Watermark, Text Overlay, Scene effects, Color borders, and Transitions for 2 scenes. Logitech Capture Software - Effects Options\r\r\rMinor Issues There are a couple of issues for me, the first one really makes me annoyed is that I cannot turn off the hotkeys for the software and I have a frameless monitor which mounting the camera is a pain in the a$$ to keep it from covering up the display - even for just a centimeter. Mounting Issue on a Frameless Monitor\r\r\rIt’s Great! Overall, I am happy with the C922 webcam - my loved ones can see me clearly during video calls. And I thank everybody for supporting me on my stream, visiting my website, and checking my Windows 10 apps.

It is the Tecware Phantom Elite TKL with Gateron brown switches. I am using it to write this post. I have used a number of mechanical keyboards in the past, the first one was an Aula one with Outemu blues. Then a TKL with blue Gateron switches, I forgot the brand, but it’s also Chinese. And my slightly premium keyboards, the Logitech G403 and the G810. The G810 was a stay-at-home keyboard for my laptop and the G403 lives in the office. And guess what, both are defective with unresponsive and ghosting keys, respectively. I thought of delaying buying a new one for “budget” reasons but coding with keyboard issues is a definitely a pain in the ass with constant deleting doubling keys and characters. I am looking for several “budget” keyboards out there, including the TNC Icarus one with Cherry MXs but the delivery time was so bad that I had to settle down with this one. Coming from Logitech, I almost passed on this one for its “gamer” font which I don’t think is clean for my desk, but my wallet said “it’s okay, you can live with that”. I bought one with brown switches since the old ones I had had Romer-Gs with a “mushy-tactile” feel on keypress so I don’t have to worry much about them on the long run. \rMy thoughts\rThe box looks premium with minimal print of the logo and keyboard model on the center. Keyboard box\r\r\rInside the box was the keyboard wrapped in plastic? with a keyboard cover made of plastic again, on top. It also came with 4 extra switches and a switch puller. Inside the box\r\r\rExtra switches with puller\r\r\rThe keyboard has a TKL layout, with software-customizable RGB setting, and replaceable switches (modular). It costs php2,500, slightly costier than their Tecware Phantoms - I’m yet to investigate why. Tecware RGB software\r\r\rAbout the “gamer” font I hated, this game with a cleaner font. Surprised am I! Though the printing of the keycaps has the “stencil” cut beneath that the LED does not shine that much. Guess I’m okay after all. Some function keys, has this cheap white printing that I fear them to get scraped off some time soon.

As I mentioned on my previous blog post here, this is my 4th mouse and my first gaming? wireless mouse. I ordered it online from DataBlitz for $39, and was delivered quickly in 2 days. \rWhat’s in the box? The box contains the wireless mouse itself, the usual manuals, Logitech Gaming promo leaflet, a blue G logo sticker, a Duracell AA battery, and a USB extension cord. \rLet’s get Physical! The mouse has no RGB strip like it’s cousins (G Pro/G203) but it has a single RGB LED that indicates colored DPI assignments in Logitech G Hub. The battery compartment and the USB receiver is accessed through the lower top part of the mouse - by sliding it off the body. I currently use an Energizer Lithium AA battery which I believe is lighter but I still keep the free battery whenever I need a heavier setup. The power switch is located below the mouse with a red and blue color indicator for off and on state. The bottom also has an extra slide compared to the G Pro/G203. The mouse shape fits perfectly in my hands and I can switch to the wired G Pro when I play some competitive games - not that this can’t do the job. But I often stick to this, G304, every time I stream my games (shameless plug - https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG/) \rReliability I used this since day one - June 2 - and I only got a hiccup once during a Dota 2 game which made me switch to wired, and since then I used this as a daily driver and on my games. Lately, I am playing Minecraft a lot, some Dota 2, CS:GO, some Valorant, Metro Exodus, just finished Mafia II: Definitive Edition, C\u0026C Yuri’s Revenge. \rVerdict, at last My overall experience using the same shape of a mouse will be just comfortable throughout my day - office job and being a small-time streamer. It also frees your hand positions by not limited by a wired mouse. Despite it not having an RGB, I would suggest this for small-handed people, for those who travel a lot and for gamers and streamers looking for a budget wireless gaming mouse. \rMore info?

As an ECE, I knew that some percentage of any electronics produced out there do have flaws - and this is not an excuse for their price - but in the “real” world, these things can happen. Also, when looking at r/mechanicalkeyboards they combo their awesome keebs with a Logitech mouse despite them hating on Romer-G’s. This is my “short” history on my Logitech mouse shopping and usage. Here it goes: If I recall correctly, my first mouse from Logitech was the G302, it has the odd shape but it just fits nicely in my hand. I used it for almost 2 years until it went “double-clicking” due to playing Dota 2. I just scavenged some old A4tech mouse and took out the switches (Huanos?) to replace one on the G302. The G302 still works today but it has this rattling noise due to the broken plastics inside. Then I bought a G203, a smaller mouse sporting with the new logo. I bought this to have an RGB mouse. This is when I started to jump on the “Logitech mouse hype”. Being on the “hype train”, I impulse bought a G403 when it became available in my country despite my current G203 still works. The G403 was not comfortable for my hand - well, the shops before don’t have demo units - so I bought another G203 as I gave the old one to my GF for office use. The G403 is stored for now. After some time, GF’s workplace decided to renovate so I took the G203 back and decided to “mod” it and cut the wire too short making it unroutable to my home setup. This older G203 is now in my “junk box”. I think all through the year 2019, I was looking to buy their wireless mouse - the G304. It has the same shape as the G203 and has the new HERO sensor. And that one time when I decided to finally buy one, I first asked a salesperson if there were any Logitech promos and I was told that the G Pro was 50% off. Without hesitation, I bought it instead of the G304. The G Pro is physically the same as G203 but has a braided cable, stiffer mouse wheel, and sporting the PMW3366 optical gaming sensor. I use this in the office with a cheap mouse bungee to keep the wire neat. Fast forward March 2020, city-wide was on lockdown, knowing that I would be staying in the office for quite some time, I lend my laptop to my GF for her to use. I also lend her the (working) G203. After some time staying in the office, I decided to neat up my desk and I found it a hassle for wires (with dual monitors, keyboards, USB cords, and whatnot) so I thought, “It’s time to check that G304 I wished for the longest time. And there’s a sale incoming too.” I checked Lazada but I was skeptical to buy electronics from them – to avoid the hassle process of returning a defective product. This is when I learned that my “favorite” gaming store I bought my previous Logitech mice has a “better” website and I checked the G304 and it was cheaper compared to its store retail price. I bought it as a gift for myself this June. Here on my desk right now is the G304 and the G Pro. I use the G304 for daily work and casual games and the G Pro for FPS and competitive gaming. I will be posting my review for the G304 soon. And sorry for the lack of better pictures of my mice.

But working on a media and broadcasting field, yet being the transmitter engineers, we can’t help but think: Uhm, how about us? Unfortunately, it took almost 2 days to formulize measures for us; don’t get me wrong, we wanted to be safe, but being the essential skeletal personnel in the operations of news source, and in my own opinion, we had to keep the broadcast on-air. To reduce public exposure, we were assigned a 7-day work-week and 7-day home-rest during the quarantine imposed by the government. During the work-week, we can stay in office (which we do most of the time) - this also to avoid the public. So as of now, I am still on my rest-week, reading programming books, self-help books, watching some Netflix, downloaded movies, playing some Minecraft and exercise, of course.

But the app is laggy as hell and eventually gave me a black screen out of nowhere - which I made a hard boot just to go back seeing things to Windows. Upon checking, it installed an older driver. (Damn AMD) Even though I use an external mech keyboard, this keyboard layout is hideous compared to the old Nitro V I had! I am missing the Pause/Break key but I believe it is hidden in F11, I believe. The ports are ok, but the Type-C is not thunderbolt. The power port is on the middle of the body!!! Nitro Sense is a great addition that it lets you control the laptop fans manually - they can get loud man! The fan layout is not “optimal” in my opinion though. Lastly, the speakers on it are s**t 🤮. \rUpgrades!!! It took me two weeks to “settle” with this new laptop and sometimes got me thinking of “regrets”. But I actually planned to upgrade memory - I just didn’t have the money 😂. I got an 8GB TeamGroup stick 2666MHz despite the CPU limit since I can re-use them (on future units or resell them), and the price difference to a 2400MHz is minimal. The unit has not easy-access so I went to a service center to install the RAM together with my old WD 500GB SSD just to have an “extra” faster storage. The service was free, and it took only 30 minutes because of some papers to fill-out but the service was fast. The unit was faster, and launching apps and games was indeed faster. I also got extra fps in games, saved seconds to minutes in Visual Studio, and Chrome tabs are saved. The only problem here now is having an older, OEM-issued drivers for the graphics card. Replaying some games with higher FPS is also a plus.
