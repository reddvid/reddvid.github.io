# App Landing Page for ZIP Code PH


Now that ZIP Code PH is available for both Android and iOS, I wanted to build a landing page for it.

# Inspiration
I viewed some designs online and found inspiration from <a href="https://get-thrive.app/" target="_blank">Thrive</a>, which I never heard of - thanks anyway!

# Launch and Land
The webpage is available <a href="https://reddavid.me/zipcodeph-app" target="_blank">HERE</a>. The page is still a link to my website but will soon acquire a domain for it soon. Also, the page is still a basic design but complete with the download links, which I will improve soon.

Will keep you updated!
