In just 2 days, I‚Äôve managed to garner a whopping 8+ hours as compared before. This also means that I am back to relieving some stress thru my beloved game Minecraft, (Survival Mode). First World? The first server I rented became toxic unenjoyable after a few months after opening it into the public - NO it‚Äôs not because of the new players, but because the server was technically ‚ÄúDONE‚Äù by having usable XP farms, stripped mines, food source, and other auto AFK farms. Which meant that new players have nothing more to do but mess around most of the time. I tried to reload the server with a new world but it kept corrupting upto the point that I reverted it back to the older (toxic) world. And I stopped playing less and less. Refreshed and New? SEASON TWO Yes, after I decided to stream again, I hastily rented a new server and invite some of my OG followers to play with me. As of now, the world is still peaceful and managed to invite more players in hoping we can live happily in the upcoming days. Unlike before, the server is now Offline-mode, meaning that non-Mojang accounts can now join - be CAREFUL though, WE CAN STILL BAN YOU.

But I knew it was a UI framework from Google which uses a single code-base for mobile and web apps. As you may know now, I developed some apps for Android and iOS using their native languages - Java and SwiftUI - and not a single-codebase language like Flutter. But I did try to code the RPN Radio app using Xamarin.Forms but the implementation of the Audio Players s*cks a$$ to be honest. Coding with their native languages was just a personal challenge for me being tech-savvy and wanted to experiment and dive myself to their ‚Äúnative world‚Äù. Android and Bad (Java) Code The Android Java code stuff was working - well, not that well - the implementation of the player was frequently bugged that it causes the app to crash. I tried several work arounds to the code to prevent the nasties, until I realized this is bad code. To satisfy myself, and the users, I challenged myself to rebuild the app using Flutter. Ever since March started, I started reading about Flutter and did some basic UI. But first, let me tell you how I installed Flutter on Windows. Pre-installation (Pre-requisites?) Make sure you have Git on your device. I installed Git for Windows I‚Äôve had Android Studio installed on my system ever since I coded for Android, which is also a recommended IDE for Flutter. Some Android SDKs and; Google Chrome browser. Installation I pretty much followed the recommended guide as stated here: Install Flutter (Windows). But instead of C:\\src\\flutter, I put it a level higher like this: C:\\flutter. Then added environment variable to Path. \u003c- This part is important if you want to run flutter commands in the command line Ran flutter doctor until all requirements are check out IDE, wait‚Ä¶ My IDE of choice is Android Studio, so I can use the emulators I already created and to avoid any additional setup when choosing another. Upon opening the IDE, it was said that creating a new Flutter project should be there on the menu screen but it was missing! Even though flutter doctor checked everything, I was disappointed that I can‚Äôt start right away. Scraping the internet for solutions, I checked Android Studio‚Äôs configuration and there, I downloaded some Flutter and Dart plugins which after a software restart, I can now create a new Flutter project. New Flutter Project\r\r\rSince, the app I am planning to rebuild in Flutter is single-paged, it is a good starting-point to play around the Flutter widgets. Coming from XAML, where everything seems ‚Äúas is‚Äù, I am so uncomfortable about coding UI using script-like codes. But having started SwiftUI for a few weeks, I pretty much can stand it. üòÖ Flutter UI Code\r\r\rBeginning Being the beginner, again, I am on my way to building to much more with Flutter with prettier code and nicer implementations. I am now reading some books and watching some tutorials on YouTube to help me advance a little more each day. Ever since February began, I have been active to coding again. Learning new stuff that I do enjoy! Thanks for reading my blog post, and will share some updates on how I would use Flutter sometime soon! Always take care peeps!

Thankfully, the audio servers have secured stream URLs for secure websites. Open Graph Metadata Social Media sites are the places where websites get the most referrers. So having metadata for them not just makes the website Facebook- or Twitter-friendly but it is a great addition to how it would look like when shared. Making the images took waaaaay longer than I expected. I decided to add 3 mockup devices that shows the website on these devices. You can see the share preview below: Facebook Open Graph Preview\r\rTwitter Open Graph Preview\r\rCreating the metadata tags was made easy by using Metatags.io.\r\r\rSite Icons I went on to also update the website‚Äôs favicons, to differentiate tunein to the news website.

We all hate ads but this is the only modest way to profit for most websites. .htaccess to Remove .html I finally made it to work, shorten the address for site navigation. Instead of showing the full file name: tunein.rpnradio.com/batac.html Some rules were added to the .htaccess file to make it tunein.rpnradio.com/batac .htaccess file: RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]\rRewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} /([^.]+)\\.html [NC]\rRewriteRule ^ /%1 [NC,L,R]\rRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}.html -f\rRewriteRule ^ %{REQUEST_URI}.html [NC,L]\r\r\rFooter Finally I added a subtle footer to the whole website.

I finally got the C922 PRO HD Webcam from Logitech after wishing having it for years. Honestly, I bought the camera in a slightly higher price due to the model being out of stock in major stores and just got from a ‚Äúhoarder‚Äù in Facebook marketplace. :) Harsh but true. Let‚Äôs get into my short blog/review/impression about this industry-standard in semi-professional streaming. \rWait You might ask, why only now? At first, I never really thought of having a good webcam as a small streamer, and I also have this app on my Android phone which makes my Nokia 7 Plus pose as a webcam. Then, I wanted the camera to be positioned well, so I bought a cheaper Logitech, the C270. Logitech C270 Webcam\r\r\rThe C270 suited my needs - stream just now and then, and it‚Äôs just right for video calls and conferencing. The only problem with this one is it has a bad exposure. I used the C270 for almost 3 months until I got the money to buy the beast of a camera, that is the C922. \rLet‚Äôs See (922) It I opened a brand new Logitech C922 way way before but it wasn‚Äôt mine, so I already know the contents (alibi for not having pictures after unboxing üòÇ). And I also tried the unit itself so I knew the quality it brings. The box contains the C922 camera, a table-top tripod, manuals and a sheet containing the free 3-month XSplit Premium codes (Again, sorry for not having pictures). Logitech C922 Box\r\r\rQuick (marketing) specs I won‚Äôt dive deep into the webcam‚Äôs specifications like weight and dimensions but here are the common ‚Äúmarketing‚Äù specs that will actually make you consider buying one: Capture 1080p @ 30fps, or 720p @ 60fps Auto focus Wide Field of View Advanced camera software \rHa! Mountable The C922 has a screw hole for mounting onto a tripod. The tripod can be extended up to 18.5cm. Here‚Äôs the closed tripod in three max lengths (with regards to the feet extensions). Logitech C922 Tripod Screw Hole and Lengths\r\r\rThe tripod, without and with the webcam. Logitech C922 Tripod\r\r\rThe C922 also has a built-in microphone but most people, including me, advice to use an external mic instead. \rLogitech Capture Upon connecting the webcam to my PC, Logitech prompted to install the companion software - Logitech Capture. The software is advanced enough for my needs - I can zoom and pan, flip the captured video horizontally and/or vertically, choose to prefer exposure or framerate, and most importantly the capture resolutions. Logitech Capture Software\r\r\rThe software provides templates for typical sizes: FHD, 720p, and 360p; Portrait: 1080x1920, 720x1280, 360x640; and Squares: 1080x1080, 720x720, and 360x360. Logitech Capture Software - Resolution Options\r\r\rThe software also allows you to add effects, text, etc with the Effects menu: Watermark, Text Overlay, Scene effects, Color borders, and Transitions for 2 scenes. Logitech Capture Software - Effects Options\r\r\rMinor Issues There are a couple of issues for me, the first one really makes me annoyed is that I cannot turn off the hotkeys for the software and I have a frameless monitor which mounting the camera is a pain in the a$$ to keep it from covering up the display - even for just a centimeter. Mounting Issue on a Frameless Monitor\r\r\rIt‚Äôs Great! Overall, I am happy with the C922 webcam - my loved ones can see me clearly during video calls. And I thank everybody for supporting me on my stream, visiting my website, and checking my Windows 10 apps. Mounting is Just Right\r\r\rTo finish this blog post, let‚Äôs all stay safe during the pandemic - and even after the pandemic.

Logitech C922","uri":"/the-logitech-c922/"},{"categories":["Stories"],"content":"This is a simple review and unboxing post for my newly bought keyboard today. It is the Tecware Phantom Elite TKL with Gateron brown switches. I am using it to write this post. I have used a number of mechanical keyboards in the past, the first one was an Aula one with Outemu blues. Then a TKL with blue Gateron switches, I forgot the brand, but it‚Äôs also Chinese. And my slightly premium keyboards, the Logitech G403 and the G810. The G810 was a stay-at-home keyboard for my laptop and the G403 lives in the office. And guess what, both are defective with unresponsive and ghosting keys, respectively. I thought of delaying buying a new one for ‚Äúbudget‚Äù reasons but coding with keyboard issues is a definitely a pain in the ass with constant deleting doubling keys and characters. I am looking for several ‚Äúbudget‚Äù keyboards out there, including the TNC Icarus one with Cherry MXs but the delivery time was so bad that I had to settle down with this one. Coming from Logitech, I almost passed on this one for its ‚Äúgamer‚Äù font which I don‚Äôt think is clean for my desk, but my wallet said ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay, you can live with that‚Äù. I bought one with brown switches since the old ones I had had Romer-Gs with a ‚Äúmushy-tactile‚Äù feel on keypress so I don‚Äôt have to worry much about them on the long run. \rMy thoughts\rThe box looks premium with minimal print of the logo and keyboard model on the center. Keyboard box\r\r\rInside the box was the keyboard wrapped in plastic? with a keyboard cover made of plastic again, on top. It also came with 4 extra switches and a switch puller. Inside the box\r\r\rExtra switches with puller\r\r\rThe keyboard has a TKL layout, with software-customizable RGB setting, and replaceable switches (modular). It costs php2,500, slightly costier than their Tecware Phantoms - I‚Äôm yet to investigate why. Tecware RGB software\r\r\rAbout the ‚Äúgamer‚Äù font I hated, this game with a cleaner font. Surprised am I! Though the printing of the keycaps has the ‚Äústencil‚Äù cut beneath that the LED does not shine that much. Guess I‚Äôm okay after all. Some function keys, has this cheap white printing that I fear them to get scraped off some time soon. The keyboard itself\r\r\rThe RGB lighting is good with bunch of built-in modes which can be visualized and edited using their software. Here‚Äôs what it looks like in an unlit office desk. RGB lighting in unlit room\r\r\rI went ahead for a typing test and got a 76wpm results with no mistyped words. But let‚Äôs see how long this budget badboy keyboard lasts. That‚Äôs all, just a short review and unboxing post for the internet people to see. If you want me to have a typing test and sound test for it, let me know. Also, my apps are still available in the Microsoft Store and some in the Google Play Store, where I mostly get my funds for buying these stuff.

As I mentioned on my previous blog post here, this is my 4th mouse and my first gaming? wireless mouse. I ordered it online from DataBlitz for $39, and was delivered quickly in 2 days. \rWhat‚Äôs in the box? The box contains the wireless mouse itself, the usual manuals, Logitech Gaming promo leaflet, a blue G logo sticker, a Duracell AA battery, and a USB extension cord. \rLet‚Äôs get Physical! The mouse has no RGB strip like it‚Äôs cousins (G Pro/G203) but it has a single RGB LED that indicates colored DPI assignments in Logitech G Hub. The battery compartment and the USB receiver is accessed through the lower top part of the mouse - by sliding it off the body. I currently use an Energizer Lithium AA battery which I believe is lighter but I still keep the free battery whenever I need a heavier setup. The power switch is located below the mouse with a red and blue color indicator for off and on state. The bottom also has an extra slide compared to the G Pro/G203. The mouse shape fits perfectly in my hands and I can switch to the wired G Pro when I play some competitive games - not that this can‚Äôt do the job. But I often stick to this, G304, every time I stream my games (shameless plug - https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG/) \rReliability I used this since day one - June 2 - and I only got a hiccup once during a Dota 2 game which made me switch to wired, and since then I used this as a daily driver and on my games. Lately, I am playing Minecraft a lot, some Dota 2, CS:GO, some Valorant, Metro Exodus, just finished Mafia II: Definitive Edition, C\u0026C Yuri‚Äôs Revenge. \rVerdict, at last My overall experience using the same shape of a mouse will be just comfortable throughout my day - office job and being a small-time streamer. It also frees your hand positions by not limited by a wired mouse. Despite it not having an RGB, I would suggest this for small-handed people, for those who travel a lot and for gamers and streamers looking for a budget wireless gaming mouse. \rMore info?

As an ECE, I knew that some percentage of any electronics produced out there do have flaws - and this is not an excuse for their price - but in the ‚Äúreal‚Äù world, these things can happen. Also, when looking at r/mechanicalkeyboards they combo their awesome keebs with a Logitech mouse despite them hating on Romer-G‚Äôs. This is my ‚Äúshort‚Äù history on my Logitech mouse shopping and usage. Here it goes: If I recall correctly, my first mouse from Logitech was the G302, it has the odd shape but it just fits nicely in my hand. I used it for almost 2 years until it went ‚Äúdouble-clicking‚Äù due to playing Dota 2. I just scavenged some old A4tech mouse and took out the switches (Huanos?) to replace one on the G302. The G302 still works today but it has this rattling noise due to the broken plastics inside. Then I bought a G203, a smaller mouse sporting with the new logo. I bought this to have an RGB mouse. This is when I started to jump on the ‚ÄúLogitech mouse hype‚Äù. Being on the ‚Äúhype train‚Äù, I impulse bought a G403 when it became available in my country despite my current G203 still works. The G403 was not comfortable for my hand - well, the shops before don‚Äôt have demo units - so I bought another G203 as I gave the old one to my GF for office use. The G403 is stored for now. After some time, GF‚Äôs workplace decided to renovate so I took the G203 back and decided to ‚Äúmod‚Äù it and cut the wire too short making it unroutable to my home setup. This older G203 is now in my ‚Äújunk box‚Äù. I think all through the year 2019, I was looking to buy their wireless mouse - the G304. It has the same shape as the G203 and has the new HERO sensor. And that one time when I decided to finally buy one, I first asked a salesperson if there were any Logitech promos and I was told that the G Pro was 50% off. Without hesitation, I bought it instead of the G304. The G Pro is physically the same as G203 but has a braided cable, stiffer mouse wheel, and sporting the PMW3366 optical gaming sensor. I use this in the office with a cheap mouse bungee to keep the wire neat. Fast forward March 2020, city-wide was on lockdown, knowing that I would be staying in the office for quite some time, I lend my laptop to my GF for her to use. I also lend her the (working) G203. After some time staying in the office, I decided to neat up my desk and I found it a hassle for wires (with dual monitors, keyboards, USB cords, and whatnot) so I thought, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to check that G304 I wished for the longest time. And there‚Äôs a sale incoming too.‚Äù I checked Lazada but I was skeptical to buy electronics from them ‚Äì to avoid the hassle process of returning a defective product. This is when I learned that my ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù gaming store I bought my previous Logitech mice has a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù website and I checked the G304 and it was cheaper compared to its store retail price. I bought it as a gift for myself this June. Here on my desk right now is the G304 and the G Pro. I use the G304 for daily work and casual games and the G Pro for FPS and competitive gaming. I will be posting my review for the G304 soon. And sorry for the lack of better pictures of my mice.

Unfortunately, it took almost 2 days to formulize measures for us; don‚Äôt get me wrong, we wanted to be safe, but being the essential skeletal personnel in the operations of news source, and in my own opinion, we had to keep the broadcast on-air.

It is an Acer Nitro 5 laptop sporting an AMD Ryzen 3550H with RX560X Graphics. This makes my 3rd Acer laptop in a span of 8+ years and my first ever AMD on a laptop (had an AMD Athlon X2 PC before). This laptop costs Php34,999 and we could not find a promo since every store follows the retail price. Although, the laptop was on promo with having an included a single stick of 8GB DDR4 memory (upgraded from 4GB), 128GB SSD (m.2 SATA) and a 1TB mechanical drive (not SSHD). The laptop includes a generic-looking backpack - yes, I said generic since I saw somewhere that there is a gaming-accented version of the bag. \rSome quick specs: AMD Ryzen 5 3550H Quad-Core with Vega 8 Graphics (which consumes 2GB of RAM) AMD Radeon RX560X 4GB DDR4 - Here‚Äôs the catch, upon checking CPU-Z the - installed memory stick is rated at 2666MHz but later found out that Ryzen 3550H is limited to 2400MHz, so maybe that is a bummer 15.6\" FHD 1920x1080p IPS LCD(slim-frame), Red Backlit-keyboard Dual M.2 (nVME only + SATA only) + 1 HDD slots Full specs of the laptop can be found here \rUsing the laptop ","date":"Feb 18, 2020","objectID":"/new-laptop/:0:0","tags":["Devices, Setup"],"title":"I Got Myself a New Laptop","uri":"/new-laptop/"},{"categories":["Stories"],"content":"Speed Coming from an Intel i7 laptop, I felt the difference in boot up times, booting on this device is slightly slower - not sure if it‚Äôs because of the SSD installed since I was using a Samsung 860 Evo on my old laptop.

Of course, I was playing either inside an aircon-ed room or the fan pointing to the laptop. Meanwhile on this new laptop, launching games, even Dota 2, was a pain. It took too long that sometimes it would just not respond and fails to load at all. But before even buying this, I said to myself that I can‚Äôt game like I did before - long hours, intensive AAA games - so I disregarded this experience, at first.

But the app is laggy as hell and eventually gave me a black screen out of nowhere - which I made a hard boot just to go back seeing things to Windows. Upon checking, it installed an older driver. (Damn AMD) Even though I use an external mech keyboard, this keyboard layout is hideous compared to the old Nitro V I had! I am missing the Pause/Break key but I believe it is hidden in F11, I believe. The ports are ok, but the Type-C is not thunderbolt. The power port is on the middle of the body!!! Nitro Sense is a great addition that it lets you control the laptop fans manually - they can get loud man! The fan layout is not ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù in my opinion though. Lastly, the speakers on it are s**t ü§Æ. \rUpgrades!!! It took me two weeks to ‚Äúsettle‚Äù with this new laptop and sometimes got me thinking of ‚Äúregrets‚Äù. But I actually planned to upgrade memory - I just didn‚Äôt have the money üòÇ. I got an 8GB TeamGroup stick 2666MHz despite the CPU limit since I can re-use them (on future units or resell them), and the price difference to a 2400MHz is minimal. The unit has not easy-access so I went to a service center to install the RAM together with my old WD 500GB SSD just to have an ‚Äúextra‚Äù faster storage. The service was free, and it took only 30 minutes because of some papers to fill-out but the service was fast. The unit was faster, and launching apps and games was indeed faster. I also got extra fps in games, saved seconds to minutes in Visual Studio, and Chrome tabs are saved. The only problem here now is having an older, OEM-issued drivers for the graphics card. Replaying some games with higher FPS is also a plus. Right now, I am thinking of upgrading to nVMe, to a higher 2.5\" SSD and 32GB RAM üò≥. \rSee me play a game on this device in YouTube Buy me a coffee or chip-in for my next upgrade Thank you ","date":"Feb 18, 2020","objectID":"/new-laptop/:0:3","tags":["Devices, Setup"],"title":"I Got Myself a New Laptop","uri":"/new-laptop/"},{"categories":["Stories"],"content":"Hey hey, recently I branched out my C# and apps knowledge to create and actually port or make versions of my UWP apps to Android using Xamarin Forms.
