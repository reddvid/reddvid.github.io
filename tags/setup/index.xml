            </div>Yoo! I finally got the C922 PRO HD Webcam from Logitech after wishing having it for years.
Honestly, I bought the camera in a slightly higher price due to the model being out of stock in major stores and just got from a &ldquo;hoarder&rdquo; in Facebook marketplace. :) Harsh but true.
Let&rsquo;s get into my short blog/review/impression about this industry-standard in semi-professional streaming.
Wait You might ask, why only now?]]></description>

            </div>This is a simple review and unboxing post for my newly bought keyboard today. It is the Tecware Phantom Elite TKL with Gateron brown switches. I am using it to write this post.
I have used a number of mechanical keyboards in the past, the first one was an Aula one with Outemu blues. Then a TKL with blue Gateron switches, I forgot the brand, but it&rsquo;s also Chinese. And my slightly premium keyboards, the Logitech G403 and the G810.]]></description>

            </div>So this is my short and honest review of the G304 wireless mouse.
As I mentioned on my previous blog post here, this is my 4th mouse and my first gaming? wireless mouse. I ordered it online from DataBlitz for $39, and was delivered quickly in 2 days.
What&rsquo;s in the box? The box contains the wireless mouse itself, the usual manuals, Logitech Gaming promo leaflet, a blue G logo sticker, a Duracell AA battery, and a USB extension cord.]]></description>

            </div>Why do (or did) I own at least 5 of Logitech G mice despite the &ldquo;double-clicking&rdquo; issues about them? As an ECE, I knew that some percentage of any electronics produced out there do have flaws - and this is not an excuse for their price - but in the &ldquo;real&rdquo; world, these things can happen. Also, when looking at r/mechanicalkeyboards they combo their awesome keebs with a Logitech mouse despite them hating on Romer-G&rsquo;s.]]></description>
