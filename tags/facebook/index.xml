        <title>Unlocked: 1K Followers</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://reddavid.me/images/feat/1k-followers.png" alt="Featured image of post Unlocked: 1K Followers" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, thank you so much to all who stayed, watched, and enjoyed my content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was on May 26th that we finally got to a thousand following after a year of starting to be a Gaming Video Creator on Facebook. The stream felt like another day of chill streaming by playing a couple of hours of Minecraft. It was quite overwhelming for a small-time (and not full-time) streamer like me but thanks to my cousins and og supporters for helping me out in the chat and Discord server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://reddavid.me/images/1k-achievement.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;1K followers achievement custom&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;strikedailystrike-nightly-streams&#34;&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Daily&lt;/strike&gt; Nightly Streams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that there&amp;rsquo;s that 1K following behind me, I will pursue to stream on a daily basis, even a short one because honestly, I miss talking and updating with them. I will also continue to improve my stream quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;not-minecraft-hello&#34;&gt;Not Minecraft, Hello?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minecraft is a really popular game we all know that, and most of my followers were because of the game. I do not expect everyone to like me playing variety of games but I still hope most could support me when I come back playing other types of games. Although, I would still join our SMP server if I fail to stream Minecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;twitchyoutube-switch&#34;&gt;Twitch/YouTube Switch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I have been thinking of switching to either one, why? First, Twitch have several audience interaction which I have been using when I watch my favorite streamers there like, watch points, play with viewers, etc and you can watch on app minimized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://reddavid.me/images/twitch-minimized.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Watch Twitch Videos Minimized&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;h4&gt;Watch Twitch Videos Minimized&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While YouTube had a better chat system, but chat highlights and audience interactions are better - with chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I held back these thoughts before since I did start my Facebook page a long time and gained a few followers. I just hoped if I made up my mind to switch, we can determine the real supporters. Maybe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it for this blog post. Thank you again for visiting my website and you can catch up on my Gaming Videos on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

        <title>Streaming Again &amp; Minecraft SMP Season 2</title>
        <link>https://reddavid.me/streaming-again-minecraft-smp-season-2/</link>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://reddavid.me/images/feat/mc-smp-s02.png" alt="Featured image of post Streaming Again &amp; Minecraft SMP Season 2" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rejoice! My more-than-a-month-long hiatus finally came to an end - I&amp;rsquo;m back to streaming video games in Facebook Gaming. In just 2 days, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to garner a whopping 8+ hours as compared before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also means that I am back to relieving some stress thru my beloved game Minecraft, (Survival Mode).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-world&#34;&gt;First World?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first server I rented became &lt;del&gt;toxic&lt;/del&gt; unenjoyable after a few months after opening it into the public - NO it&amp;rsquo;s not because of the new players, but because the server was technically &amp;ldquo;DONE&amp;rdquo; by having usable XP farms, stripped mines, food source, and other auto AFK farms. Which meant that new players have nothing more to do but mess around most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to reload the server with a new world but it kept corrupting upto the point that I reverted it back to the older (toxic) world. And I stopped playing less and less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;refreshed-and-new-season-2&#34;&gt;Refreshed and New? Season 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, after I decided to stream again, I hastily rented a new server and invite some of my OG followers to play with me. As of now, the world is still peaceful and managed to invite more players in hoping we can live happily in the upcoming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike before, the server is now Offline-mode, meaning that non-Mojang accounts can now join - be CAREFUL though, WE CAN STILL &lt;strong&gt;BAN&lt;/strong&gt; YOU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wanna-join&#34;&gt;Wanna Join?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head over to our Discord server for the rules and guidelines, and for the Server IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://discord.gg/rKnJb4J&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Red David Discord Server&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to Own a Minecraft Server&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosted by Shockbyte, cheap and reliable servers are offered for you. Check them out &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://bit.ly/ShockByteMC&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hello-1k-followers&#34;&gt;Hello 1K Followers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been aiming to reach followers before the year 2020 ends but I failed to do so, much more that I stopped streaming for more than a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with regained confidence, I am on the path to reach that goal while improving my streaming. So head over to my &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Facebook Gaming Page&lt;/a&gt; and see if you like me to gain a Follow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;facebook-stars-&#34;&gt;Facebook Stars ‚ú®üåü‚≠ê&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I tried streaming mobile games now and then but the current setup is not suited for it. I am slowly building funds to get the setup for mobile games too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Receiving stars during my live streams are very much appreciated by placing your names on my Starwall here: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://reddavid.me/starwall&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-ways-to-support&#34;&gt;Other Ways to Support&lt;/h2&gt;
