    <title>RPN Radio UI Overhaul</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/rpnradio-ui-overhaul/</link>
    <pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 00:15:36 &#43;0800</pubDate><dc:creator>David</dc:creator><guid>https://reddavid.me/rpnradio-ui-overhaul/</guid>

            </div><p>Browsing Instagram on my account now floods me with several UI/UX tips and practices, making me inspired to update and retouch my apps with some latest trends in mobile designs.</p>
<h1 id="old-look">Old Look</h1>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at what the app looked like before the update:</p>
<figure class="image">


<figcaption><em>Old UI</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>Though it looked intuitive - with just two simple steps: 1) Launch app, 2) Select station and Listen; the main page does not give the user context on what the app does, which raise this question:</p>
<p><strong><em>What am I supposed to do?</em></strong></p>
<h2 id="menu-list">Menu List</h2>
<p>At first glance of a first-time user, the stations list does NOT show that it is &ldquo;clickable&rdquo;. So the first UI update was to change the 4x3 grid to a simple list.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Station Menu Item Before and After</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>This subtle change provides the user a hint of &ldquo;click me&rdquo; by giving the list item a design of a button. It also gave a space for the station&rsquo;s detail to be added - station&rsquo;s location and live/offline status.</p>
<h2 id="header-and-controls">Header and Controls</h2>
<p>Ok, this area will look crammed especially on small-screen devices. Before this update though, I repositioned the buttons below the controls and were still crammed. This update allowed the horizontal list to be scrolled.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Header & Controls Before and After</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>I also changed the text that shows the current stations into a simpler one and updated the share icon.</p>
<h2 id="new-font">New Font</h2>
<p>I like <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Poppins</a>.
<br></p>
<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>Besides the UI updates mentioned above, I added an &ldquo;About&rdquo; page. It is a simple about and external links of RPN.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>About page</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<h1 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h1>
<p>These are my to-do list for the app, which we will see soon on future updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>No internet connection status</li>
<li>Bottom player controls (Priority)</li>
<li>App-aware sharing</li>
<li>Rate and review prompt</li>
<li>Links to station email/messaging</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="downloads">Downloads</h1>
<p>As always, the app is still available for Android and (REALLY) soon for iOS.</p>
<p>Google Play Store: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rpnradio.radiov1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rpnradio.radiov1</a></p>
<p>Huawei App Gallery: <a href="https://appgallery.huawei.com/#/app/C103076031" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://appgallery.huawei.com/#/app/C103076031</a></p>

    <title>Developing for Apple Soon</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/developing-for-apple-soon/</link>

            </div><h1 id="apple-user---me">Apple User -&gt; Me</h1>
<p>Yes, I gave in to use an Apple device. Well, I&rsquo;ve tried an iPhone XS before, and I must admit, having a device with software dedicated to its hardware is chef&rsquo;s kiss. That&rsquo;s what I liked about Apple, the hardware and software work along each other, and like most people, the price-tag for their phones held me back until December.</p>
<p>I <em>loaned</em> for an iPhone 11 since the iPhone 12 is expensive and I like the 11&rsquo;s grip instead of the sharp edges of the new design. I got a yellow one since the black sold out. Then I realized black, though very simple, is such a generic color that it doesn&rsquo;t stand out as a phone&rsquo;s color and I&rsquo;ve had too many black phones before.</p>
<figure class="image">

<br/>
<h1 id="developing-for-ios-soon">Developing for iOS soon</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to learn new things and finally applying the cross-platform capabilities of <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin/xamarin-forms">Xamarin.Forms</a> which I have used in some of my Android apps and it&rsquo;s <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/">C#</a>. I also want to check out native code from Apple, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a>.</p>
<p>Developing for Apple is quite costly, that you need to own a Mac (or rent online) and â‚±4450 ($99) for an individual to publish to the App Store. And it is YEARLY.</p>
<figure class="image">

<br/>
<p>So, to test things out, I would be putting my app <a href="/zipcodeph-android-dark-mode/">ZIP Code PH</a> on the App Store and might set a (very very small) price to support this costly Apple environment ðŸ˜‚.</p>
<h1 id="for-the-meantime">For the meantime&hellip;</h1>
<p>Go ahead and check out my apps on the <a href="ms-windows-store:publisher?name=Red David">Windows 10 Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=5465762079490576029">Google Play Store</a> both under Red David.</p>
<p>See you soon!</p>
