# RPN Android App


Hey hey, recently I branched out my C# and apps knowledge to create and actually port or make versions of my UWP apps to Android using Xamarin Forms.

Finally opt-in and registered to Google Play platform and chose RPN News & Radio to the Store as the first app (under my registered dev name) to become publicly available.

Obviously, this is unofficial and not backed by my employers. I believe having this in the store is essential to expand the platforms reached by RPN.

Also, there are some adjustments I needed to learn in using Xamarin Forms, and had to merge several projects to create both the news and radio part of the app. Thanks to open source!

There are still bugs, I know, but help by checking the app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.reddvid.rpnradio" taget="_blank">here</a>
