            </div>Yoo! I finally got the C922 PRO HD Webcam from Logitech after wishing having it for years.
Honestly, I bought the camera in a slightly higher price due to the model being out of stock in major stores and just got from a &ldquo;hoarder&rdquo; in Facebook marketplace. :) Harsh but true.
Let&rsquo;s get into my short blog/review/impression about this industry-standard in semi-professional streaming.
Wait You might ask, why only now?]]></description>

            </div>So this is my short and honest review of the G304 wireless mouse.
As I mentioned on my previous blog post here, this is my 4th mouse and my first gaming? wireless mouse. I ordered it online from DataBlitz for $39, and was delivered quickly in 2 days.
What&rsquo;s in the box? The box contains the wireless mouse itself, the usual manuals, Logitech Gaming promo leaflet, a blue G logo sticker, a Duracell AA battery, and a USB extension cord.]]></description>
