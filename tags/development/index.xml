            </div><h1 id="the-pandemic-and-night-owls">The Pandemic and Night Owls</h1>
<p>My app, ZIP Code PH, has been available on Google Play Store for more than a year now and because of the pandemic, more and more people are staying at home and are mostly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_owl_(person)">night-owls</a>.</p>
<p>And app and software developers are now giving their projects dark mode - not just to follow accessibility standards but offer an option for people to reduce or avoid eye strain.</p>
<h1 id="heres-dark-mode-for-ya">Here&rsquo;s Dark Mode for ya</h1>
<p>So here I am, picking up again on coding (for my apps) and started giving some apps a dark flavor. It almost took me a month to develop and test since available Xamarin Forms documentation didn&rsquo;t suit my liking.</p>
<h1 id="quick-app-features">Quick App Features</h1>
<ul>
<li>Toggle light and dark mode</li>
<li>Quick search Philippine ZIP codes</li>
<li>Favorite (Bookmark) selected ZIP codes for easy reference</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="screenshots">Screenshots</h1>
<p>See for yourself the light and dark mode for the app below.</p>

<p>I chose <code>#222222</code> as the background color for darkmode so it is easier in the eyes (at least for me and some design posts I read somewhere). If someone requests an option for a darker color, I&rsquo;d be glad to add it. (Themes, maybe? ðŸ¤”)</p>
<h1 id="make-me-happy">Make me happy</h1>
<p>Yes, please. Make me happy by downloading the app, write a review and give a rating of 5 stars. The app is available for Android, on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.reddvid.zipcodeph">Google Play Store</a> and <a href="https://appgallery.huawei.com/#/app/C103245343">Huawei App Gallery.</a></p>
<p>It is free to download, I hope you welcome ads that earns a me a little. Thank you and until next app!</p>

    <title>I Got Myself a New Laptop</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/new-laptop/</link>

    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/feat/acer-laptop.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>Last February 15, I got myself a new Acer laptop. It is an Acer Nitro 5 laptop sporting an AMD Ryzen 3550H with RX560X Graphics. This makes my 3rd Acer laptop in a span of 8+ years and my first ever AMD on a laptop (had an AMD Athlon X2 PC before).</p>
<p>This laptop costs Php34,999 and we could not find a promo since every store follows the retail price. Although, the laptop was <em>on promo</em> with having an included a single stick of 8GB DDR4 memory (upgraded from 4GB), 128GB SSD (m.2 SATA) and a 1TB mechanical drive (not SSHD).</p>
<p>The laptop includes a generic-looking backpack - yes, I said generic since I saw somewhere that there is a <em>gaming-accented</em> version of the bag.</p>
</br>
<h1 id="some-quick-specs">Some quick specs:</h1>
<ul>
<li>AMD Ryzen 5 3550H Quad-Core with Vega 8 Graphics (which consumes 2GB of RAM)</li>
<li>AMD Radeon RX560X 4GB DDR4 - Here&rsquo;s the catch, upon checking CPU-Z the - installed memory stick is rated at 2666MHz but later found out that Ryzen 3550H is limited to 2400MHz, so maybe that is a bummer</li>
<li>15.6&quot; FHD 1920x1080p IPS LCD(slim-frame), Red Backlit-keyboard</li>
<li>Dual M.2 (nVME only + SATA only) + 1 HDD slots</li>
</ul>
<p>Full specs of the laptop can be found <a href="https://www.acer.com/ac/en/GB/content/model/NH.Q5XEK.008">here</a></p>
</br>
<h1 id="using-the-laptop">Using the laptop</h1>
<h3 id="speed">Speed</h3>
<p>Coming from an Intel i7 laptop, I felt the difference in boot up times, booting on this device is slightly slower - not sure if it&rsquo;s because of the SSD installed since I was using a Samsung 860 Evo on my old laptop.</p>
<p>Next is using Visual Studio, rebuilding some of my apps takes a longer time to finish. Also, having only 6GB of memory (since the 2GB is shared to CPU?) I can&rsquo;t stand having my chrome tabs reload after a while.</p>
<h3 id="gaming">Gaming</h3>
<p>Before my old laptop broke (which was an Acer Nitro V, with an Intel i7 4th gen + 2GB GTX960M), I was just playing some Minecraft (sometimes with Shaders), some casual Dota 2, and other medium-intensive games.</p>
<p>Of course, I was playing either inside an aircon-ed room or the fan pointing to the laptop.</p>
<p>Meanwhile on this new laptop, launching games, even Dota 2, was a pain. It took too long that sometimes it would just not respond and fails to load at all.</p>
<p>But before even buying this, I said to myself that I can&rsquo;t game like I did before - long hours, intensive AAA games - so I disregarded this experience, at first.</p>
<h3 id="overall-system-experience">Overall (System) Experience</h3>
<p>Out of habit, I installed the latest drivers including Radeon software (Adrenaline 2020). But the app is laggy as hell and eventually gave me a black screen out of nowhere - which I made a hard boot just to go back seeing things to Windows.</p>
<p>Upon checking, it installed an older driver. (Damn AMD)</p>
<p>Even though I use an external mech keyboard, this keyboard layout is hideous compared to the old Nitro V I had! I am missing the Pause/Break key but I believe it is hidden in F11, I believe.</p>
<p>The ports are ok, but the Type-C is not thunderbolt. The power port is on the middle of the body!!!</p>
<p>Nitro Sense is a great addition that it lets you control the laptop fans manually - they can get loud man! The fan layout is not &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; in my opinion though.</p>
<p>Lastly, the speakers on it are s**t ðŸ¤®.</p>
</br>
<h1 id="upgrades">Upgrades!!!</h1>
<p>It took me two weeks to &ldquo;settle&rdquo; with this new laptop and sometimes got me thinking of &ldquo;regrets&rdquo;. But I actually planned to upgrade memory - I just didn&rsquo;t have the money ðŸ˜‚.</p>
<p>I got an 8GB TeamGroup stick 2666MHz despite the CPU limit since I can re-use them (on future units or resell them), and the price difference to a 2400MHz is minimal.</p>
<p>The unit has not easy-access so I went to a service center to install the RAM together with my old WD 500GB SSD just to have an &ldquo;extra&rdquo; faster storage. The service was free, and it took only 30 minutes because of some papers to fill-out but the service was fast.</p>
<p>The unit was faster, and launching apps and games was indeed faster. I also got extra fps in games, saved seconds to minutes in Visual Studio, and Chrome tabs are saved.</p>
<p>The only problem here now is having an older, OEM-issued drivers for the graphics card.</p>
<p>Replaying some games with higher FPS is also a plus.</p>
<p>Right now, I am thinking of upgrading to nVMe, to a higher 2.5&quot; SSD and 32GB RAM ðŸ˜³.</p>
