            </div><p>Last February 15, I got myself a new Acer laptop. It is an Acer Nitro 5 laptop sporting an AMD Ryzen 3550H with RX560X Graphics. This makes my 3rd Acer laptop in a span of 8+ years and my first ever AMD on a laptop (had an AMD Athlon X2 PC before).</p>
<p>This laptop costs Php34,999 and we could not find a promo since every store follows the retail price. Although, the laptop was <em>on promo</em> with having an included a single stick of 8GB DDR4 memory (upgraded from 4GB), 128GB SSD (m.2 SATA) and a 1TB mechanical drive (not SSHD).</p>
<p>The laptop includes a generic-looking backpack - yes, I said generic since I saw somewhere that there is a <em>gaming-accented</em> version of the bag.</p>
</br>
<h1 id="some-quick-specs">Some quick specs:</h1>
<ul>
<li>AMD Ryzen 5 3550H Quad-Core with Vega 8 Graphics (which consumes 2GB of RAM)</li>
<li>AMD Radeon RX560X 4GB DDR4 - Here&rsquo;s the catch, upon checking CPU-Z the - installed memory stick is rated at 2666MHz but later found out that Ryzen 3550H is limited to 2400MHz, so maybe that is a bummer</li>
<li>15.6&quot; FHD 1920x1080p IPS LCD(slim-frame), Red Backlit-keyboard</li>
<li>Dual M.2 (nVME only + SATA only) + 1 HDD slots</li>
</ul>
<p>Full specs of the laptop can be found <a href="https://www.acer.com/ac/en/GB/content/model/NH.Q5XEK.008">here</a></p>

<h1 id="using-the-laptop">Using the laptop</h1>
<h3 id="speed">Speed</h3>
<p>Coming from an Intel i7 laptop, I felt the difference in boot up times, booting on this device is slightly slower - not sure if it&rsquo;s because of the SSD installed since I was using a Samsung 860 Evo on my old laptop.</p>
<p>Next is using Visual Studio, rebuilding some of my apps takes a longer time to finish. Also, having only 6GB of memory (since the 2GB is shared to CPU?) I can&rsquo;t stand having my chrome tabs reload after a while.</p>
<h3 id="gaming">Gaming</h3>
<p>Before my old laptop broke (which was an Acer Nitro V, with an Intel i7 4th gen + 2GB GTX960M), I was just playing some Minecraft (sometimes with Shaders), some casual Dota 2, and other medium-intensive games.</p>
<p>Of course, I was playing either inside an aircon-ed room or the fan pointing to the laptop.</p>
<p>Meanwhile on this new laptop, launching games, even Dota 2, was a pain. It took too long that sometimes it would just not respond and fails to load at all.</p>
<p>But before even buying this, I said to myself that I can&rsquo;t game like I did before - long hours, intensive AAA games - so I disregarded this experience, at first.</p>
<h3 id="overall-system-experience">Overall (System) Experience</h3>
<p>Out of habit, I installed the latest drivers including Radeon software (Adrenaline 2020). But the app is laggy as hell and eventually gave me a black screen out of nowhere - which I made a hard boot just to go back seeing things to Windows.</p>
<p>Upon checking, it installed an older driver. (Damn AMD)</p>
<p>Even though I use an external mech keyboard, this keyboard layout is hideous compared to the old Nitro V I had! I am missing the Pause/Break key but I believe it is hidden in F11, I believe.</p>
<p>The ports are ok, but the Type-C is not thunderbolt. The power port is on the middle of the body!!!</p>
<p>Nitro Sense is a great addition that it lets you control the laptop fans manually - they can get loud man! The fan layout is not &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; in my opinion though.</p>
<p>Lastly, the speakers on it are s**t ðŸ¤®.</p>
</br>
<h1 id="upgrades">Upgrades!!!</h1>
<p>It took me two weeks to &ldquo;settle&rdquo; with this new laptop and sometimes got me thinking of &ldquo;regrets&rdquo;. But I actually planned to upgrade memory - I just didn&rsquo;t have the money ðŸ˜‚.</p>
<p>I got an 8GB TeamGroup stick 2666MHz despite the CPU limit since I can re-use them (on future units or resell them), and the price difference to a 2400MHz is minimal.</p>
<p>The unit has not easy-access so I went to a service center to install the RAM together with my old WD 500GB SSD just to have an &ldquo;extra&rdquo; faster storage. The service was free, and it took only 30 minutes because of some papers to fill-out but the service was fast.</p>
<p>The unit was faster, and launching apps and games was indeed faster. I also got extra fps in games, saved seconds to minutes in Visual Studio, and Chrome tabs are saved.</p>
<p>The only problem here now is having an older, OEM-issued drivers for the graphics card.</p>
<p>Replaying some games with higher FPS is also a plus.</p>
<p>Right now, I am thinking of upgrading to nVMe, to a higher 2.5&quot; SSD and 32GB RAM ðŸ˜³.</p>
