        <description>&lt;img src="https://reddavid.me/images/hugo.png" alt="Featured image of post Rebuilding Website with Hugo" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was early 2019, I think when I accidentally deleted my WordPress database that contains at least 20 posts. Sad right? After that sad moment, I tried to repost everything using Hugo, a static website builder, but found that it was too complicated - with YAML, some .scss, layouts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I gave up and made a basic website with just HTML, CSS, and JS files. It was ok for me, just having a landing page for my apps, other works and a short bio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until I do wanted to do some blog, not that daily blog but just somewhere to share my thoughts. So here we are again, I would actually give time to understand Hugo and what not. Welcome me again!&lt;/p&gt;
