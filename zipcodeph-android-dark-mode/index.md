# ZIP Code PH for Android gets Dark Mode


# The Pandemic and Night Owls
My app, ZIP Code PH, has been available on Google Play Store for more than a year now and because of the pandemic, more and more people are staying at home and are mostly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_owl_(person)">night-owls</a>.

And app and software developers are now giving their projects dark mode - not just to follow accessibility standards but offer an option for people to reduce or avoid eye strain.

# Here's Dark Mode for ya
So here I am, picking up again on coding (for my apps) and started giving some apps a dark flavor. It almost took me a month to develop and test since available Xamarin Forms documentation didn't suit my liking.

# Quick App Features
- Toggle light and dark mode
- Quick search Philippine ZIP codes
- Favorite (Bookmark) selected ZIP codes for easy reference

# Screenshots
See for yourself the light and dark mode for the app below.

I chose <code>#222222</code> as the background color for darkmode so it is easier in the eyes (at least for me and some design posts I read somewhere). If someone requests an option for a darker color, I'd be glad to add it. (Themes, maybe? ðŸ¤”)
