I finally got the C922 PRO HD Webcam from Logitech after wishing having it for years. Honestly, I bought the camera in a slightly higher price due to the model being out of stock in major stores and just got from a ‚Äúhoarder‚Äù in Facebook marketplace. :) Harsh but true. Let‚Äôs get into my short blog/review/impression about this industry-standard in semi-professional streaming. \rWait You might ask, why only now? At first, I never really thought of having a good webcam as a small streamer, and I also have this app on my Android phone which makes my Nokia 7 Plus pose as a webcam. Then, I wanted the camera to be positioned well, so I bought a cheaper Logitech, the C270. Logitech C270 Webcam\r\r\rThe C270 suited my needs - stream just now and then, and it‚Äôs just right for video calls and conferencing. The only problem with this one is it has a bad exposure. I used the C270 for almost 3 months until I got the money to buy the beast of a camera, that is the C922. \rLet‚Äôs See (922) It I opened a brand new Logitech C922 way way before but it wasn‚Äôt mine, so I already know the contents (alibi for not having pictures after unboxing üòÇ). And I also tried the unit itself so I knew the quality it brings. The box contains the C922 camera, a table-top tripod, manuals and a sheet containing the free 3-month XSplit Premium codes (Again, sorry for not having pictures). Logitech C922 Box\r\r\rQuick (marketing) specs I won‚Äôt dive deep into the webcam‚Äôs specifications like weight and dimensions but here are the common ‚Äúmarketing‚Äù specs that will actually make you consider buying one: Capture 1080p @ 30fps, or 720p @ 60fps Auto focus Wide Field of View Advanced camera software \rHa! Mountable The C922 has a screw hole for mounting onto a tripod. The tripod can be extended up to 18.5cm. Here‚Äôs the closed tripod in three max lengths (with regards to the feet extensions). Logitech C922 Tripod Screw Hole and Lengths\r\r\rThe tripod, without and with the webcam. Logitech C922 Tripod\r\r\rThe C922 also has a built-in microphone but most people, including me, advice to use an external mic instead. \rLogitech Capture Upon connecting the webcam to my PC, Logitech prompted to install the companion software - Logitech Capture. The software is advanced enough for my needs - I can zoom and pan, flip the captured video horizontally and/or vertically, choose to prefer exposure or framerate, and most importantly the capture resolutions. Logitech Capture Software\r\r\rThe software provides templates for typical sizes: FHD, 720p, and 360p; Portrait: 1080x1920, 720x1280, 360x640; and Squares: 1080x1080, 720x720, and 360x360. Logitech Capture Software - Resolution Options\r\r\rThe software also allows you to add effects, text, etc with the Effects menu: Watermark, Text Overlay, Scene effects, Color borders, and Transitions for 2 scenes. Logitech Capture Software - Effects Options\r\r\rMinor Issues There are a couple of issues for me, the first one really makes me annoyed is that I cannot turn off the hotkeys for the software and I have a frameless monitor which mounting the camera is a pain in the a$$ to keep it from covering up the display - even for just a centimeter. Mounting Issue on a Frameless Monitor\r\r\rIt‚Äôs Great! Overall, I am happy with the C922 webcam - my loved ones can see me clearly during video calls. And I thank everybody for supporting me on my stream, visiting my website, and checking my Windows 10 apps. Mounting is Just Right\r\r\rTo finish this blog post, let‚Äôs all stay safe during the pandemic - and even after the pandemic.

Logitech C922","uri":"/the-logitech-c922/"},{"categories":["Stories"],"content":"This is a simple review and unboxing post for my newly bought keyboard today. It is the Tecware Phantom Elite TKL with Gateron brown switches. I am using it to write this post. I have used a number of mechanical keyboards in the past, the first one was an Aula one with Outemu blues. Then a TKL with blue Gateron switches, I forgot the brand, but it‚Äôs also Chinese. And my slightly premium keyboards, the Logitech G403 and the G810. The G810 was a stay-at-home keyboard for my laptop and the G403 lives in the office. And guess what, both are defective with unresponsive and ghosting keys, respectively. I thought of delaying buying a new one for ‚Äúbudget‚Äù reasons but coding with keyboard issues is a definitely a pain in the ass with constant deleting doubling keys and characters. I am looking for several ‚Äúbudget‚Äù keyboards out there, including the TNC Icarus one with Cherry MXs but the delivery time was so bad that I had to settle down with this one. Coming from Logitech, I almost passed on this one for its ‚Äúgamer‚Äù font which I don‚Äôt think is clean for my desk, but my wallet said ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay, you can live with that‚Äù. I bought one with brown switches since the old ones I had had Romer-Gs with a ‚Äúmushy-tactile‚Äù feel on keypress so I don‚Äôt have to worry much about them on the long run. \rMy thoughts\rThe box looks premium with minimal print of the logo and keyboard model on the center. Keyboard box\r\r\rInside the box was the keyboard wrapped in plastic? with a keyboard cover made of plastic again, on top. It also came with 4 extra switches and a switch puller. Inside the box\r\r\rExtra switches with puller\r\r\rThe keyboard has a TKL layout, with software-customizable RGB setting, and replaceable switches (modular). It costs php2,500, slightly costier than their Tecware Phantoms - I‚Äôm yet to investigate why. Tecware RGB software\r\r\rAbout the ‚Äúgamer‚Äù font I hated, this game with a cleaner font. Surprised am I! Though the printing of the keycaps has the ‚Äústencil‚Äù cut beneath that the LED does not shine that much. Guess I‚Äôm okay after all. Some function keys, has this cheap white printing that I fear them to get scraped off some time soon. The keyboard itself\r\r\rThe RGB lighting is good with bunch of built-in modes which can be visualized and edited using their software. Here‚Äôs what it looks like in an unlit office desk. RGB lighting in unlit room\r\r\rI went ahead for a typing test and got a 76wpm results with no mistyped words. But let‚Äôs see how long this budget badboy keyboard lasts. That‚Äôs all, just a short review and unboxing post for the internet people to see. If you want me to have a typing test and sound test for it, let me know. Also, my apps are still available in the Microsoft Store and some in the Google Play Store, where I mostly get my funds for buying these stuff.

As I mentioned on my previous blog post here, this is my 4th mouse and my first gaming? wireless mouse. I ordered it online from DataBlitz for $39, and was delivered quickly in 2 days. \rWhat‚Äôs in the box? The box contains the wireless mouse itself, the usual manuals, Logitech Gaming promo leaflet, a blue G logo sticker, a Duracell AA battery, and a USB extension cord. \rLet‚Äôs get Physical! The mouse has no RGB strip like it‚Äôs cousins (G Pro/G203) but it has a single RGB LED that indicates colored DPI assignments in Logitech G Hub. The battery compartment and the USB receiver is accessed through the lower top part of the mouse - by sliding it off the body. I currently use an Energizer Lithium AA battery which I believe is lighter but I still keep the free battery whenever I need a heavier setup. The power switch is located below the mouse with a red and blue color indicator for off and on state. The bottom also has an extra slide compared to the G Pro/G203. The mouse shape fits perfectly in my hands and I can switch to the wired G Pro when I play some competitive games - not that this can‚Äôt do the job. But I often stick to this, G304, every time I stream my games (shameless plug - https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG/) \rReliability I used this since day one - June 2 - and I only got a hiccup once during a Dota 2 game which made me switch to wired, and since then I used this as a daily driver and on my games. Lately, I am playing Minecraft a lot, some Dota 2, CS:GO, some Valorant, Metro Exodus, just finished Mafia II: Definitive Edition, C\u0026C Yuri‚Äôs Revenge. \rVerdict, at last My overall experience using the same shape of a mouse will be just comfortable throughout my day - office job and being a small-time streamer. It also frees your hand positions by not limited by a wired mouse. Despite it not having an RGB, I would suggest this for small-handed people, for those who travel a lot and for gamers and streamers looking for a budget wireless gaming mouse. \rMore info?

As an ECE, I knew that some percentage of any electronics produced out there do have flaws - and this is not an excuse for their price - but in the ‚Äúreal‚Äù world, these things can happen. Also, when looking at r/mechanicalkeyboards they combo their awesome keebs with a Logitech mouse despite them hating on Romer-G‚Äôs. This is my ‚Äúshort‚Äù history on my Logitech mouse shopping and usage. Here it goes: If I recall correctly, my first mouse from Logitech was the G302, it has the odd shape but it just fits nicely in my hand. I used it for almost 2 years until it went ‚Äúdouble-clicking‚Äù due to playing Dota 2. I just scavenged some old A4tech mouse and took out the switches (Huanos?) to replace one on the G302. The G302 still works today but it has this rattling noise due to the broken plastics inside. Then I bought a G203, a smaller mouse sporting with the new logo. I bought this to have an RGB mouse. This is when I started to jump on the ‚ÄúLogitech mouse hype‚Äù. Being on the ‚Äúhype train‚Äù, I impulse bought a G403 when it became available in my country despite my current G203 still works. The G403 was not comfortable for my hand - well, the shops before don‚Äôt have demo units - so I bought another G203 as I gave the old one to my GF for office use. The G403 is stored for now. After some time, GF‚Äôs workplace decided to renovate so I took the G203 back and decided to ‚Äúmod‚Äù it and cut the wire too short making it unroutable to my home setup. This older G203 is now in my ‚Äújunk box‚Äù. I think all through the year 2019, I was looking to buy their wireless mouse - the G304. It has the same shape as the G203 and has the new HERO sensor. And that one time when I decided to finally buy one, I first asked a salesperson if there were any Logitech promos and I was told that the G Pro was 50% off. Without hesitation, I bought it instead of the G304. The G Pro is physically the same as G203 but has a braided cable, stiffer mouse wheel, and sporting the PMW3366 optical gaming sensor. I use this in the office with a cheap mouse bungee to keep the wire neat. Fast forward March 2020, city-wide was on lockdown, knowing that I would be staying in the office for quite some time, I lend my laptop to my GF for her to use. I also lend her the (working) G203. After some time staying in the office, I decided to neat up my desk and I found it a hassle for wires (with dual monitors, keyboards, USB cords, and whatnot) so I thought, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to check that G304 I wished for the longest time. And there‚Äôs a sale incoming too.‚Äù I checked Lazada but I was skeptical to buy electronics from them ‚Äì to avoid the hassle process of returning a defective product. This is when I learned that my ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù gaming store I bought my previous Logitech mice has a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù website and I checked the G304 and it was cheaper compared to its store retail price. I bought it as a gift for myself this June. Here on my desk right now is the G304 and the G Pro. I use the G304 for daily work and casual games and the G Pro for FPS and competitive gaming. I will be posting my review for the G304 soon. And sorry for the lack of better pictures of my mice.

Unfortunately, it took almost 2 days to formulize measures for us; don‚Äôt get me wrong, we wanted to be safe, but being the essential skeletal personnel in the operations of news source, and in my own opinion, we had to keep the broadcast on-air.

Of course, I was playing either inside an aircon-ed room or the fan pointing to the laptop. Meanwhile on this new laptop, launching games, even Dota 2, was a pain. It took too long that sometimes it would just not respond and fails to load at all. But before even buying this, I said to myself that I can‚Äôt game like I did before - long hours, intensive AAA games - so I disregarded this experience, at first.

But the app is laggy as hell and eventually gave me a black screen out of nowhere - which I made a hard boot just to go back seeing things to Windows. Upon checking, it installed an older driver. (Damn AMD) Even though I use an external mech keyboard, this keyboard layout is hideous compared to the old Nitro V I had! I am missing the Pause/Break key but I believe it is hidden in F11, I believe. The ports are ok, but the Type-C is not thunderbolt. The power port is on the middle of the body!!! Nitro Sense is a great addition that it lets you control the laptop fans manually - they can get loud man! The fan layout is not ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù in my opinion though. Lastly, the speakers on it are s**t ü§Æ. \rUpgrades!!! It took me two weeks to ‚Äúsettle‚Äù with this new laptop and sometimes got me thinking of ‚Äúregrets‚Äù. But I actually planned to upgrade memory - I just didn‚Äôt have the money üòÇ. I got an 8GB TeamGroup stick 2666MHz despite the CPU limit since I can re-use them (on future units or resell them), and the price difference to a 2400MHz is minimal. The unit has not easy-access so I went to a service center to install the RAM together with my old WD 500GB SSD just to have an ‚Äúextra‚Äù faster storage. The service was free, and it took only 30 minutes because of some papers to fill-out but the service was fast. The unit was faster, and launching apps and games was indeed faster. I also got extra fps in games, saved seconds to minutes in Visual Studio, and Chrome tabs are saved. The only problem here now is having an older, OEM-issued drivers for the graphics card. Replaying some games with higher FPS is also a plus. Right now, I am thinking of upgrading to nVMe, to a higher 2.5\" SSD and 32GB RAM üò≥. \rSee me play a game on this device in YouTube Buy me a coffee or chip-in for my next upgrade Thank you ","date":"18/Feb/2020","objectID":"/new-laptop/:0:3","tags":["Devices, Setup"],"title":"I Got Myself a New Laptop","uri":"/new-laptop/"},{"categories":["Stories"],"content":"Hey hey, recently I branched out my C# and apps knowledge to create and actually port or make versions of my UWP apps to Android using Xamarin Forms. Finally opt-in and registered to Google Play platform and chose RPN News \u0026 Radio to the Store as the first app (under my registered dev name) to become publicly available. Obviously, this is unofficial and not backed by my employers. I believe having this in the store is essential to expand the platforms reached by RPN. Also, there are some adjustments I needed to learn in using Xamarin Forms, and had to merge several projects to create both the news and radio part of the app. Thanks to open source!

Then came Windows 8.1 and WP8.1 on the Univeral App Shared codes, but didn‚Äôt dive that deep because of some weird Windows 8.1 windowing and such. Finally W10 and UWP, still slowly learning and managed to improve my coding skills. Most of my WP7/8 apps were unpublished due to failure to update them, but right now a set of Windows 10 Apps is available for download. I have yet to get my own domain though.
