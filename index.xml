&lt;p&gt;Hi! I am David. I am an electronics engineer and a software programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work in broadcast field for more than 5 years. I code and develop apps on my rest days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I manage RPN Radio CMS website and other digital media (e.g. live stream, social media, cPanel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also an experienced object-oriented programming using C#. I also happen to know XAML, SQL, and Git. I use Visual Studio, VS Code, and Illustrator/Figma to design app logos, UI mockups, and promo images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started coding in college for our project study, RFID Gate System. We used VB.Net for the software and C++ for the Arduino microprocessor. After that, I got started in Windows Phone App development and learned C#, XAML, and Git. The first apps I created were mostly for personal-use until I registered and submitted one to the Windows Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I started coding apps which helped me simplify the jobs I do - from monitoring and reporting data and statistics to automating web interactions. What started as a hobby became a small source of income. I have more than a dozen apps available right now in the Windows 10 Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And right now, I am learning web development and looking forward to get a Microsoft Certification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bio&#34;&gt;Bio&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born and raised in a small town in Pangasinan, Philippines on 14th of June, 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can speak Filipino (Tagalog), and English (spoken: 8, written: 9). I can also speak in my local dialect, Pangasinan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took up Electronics Engineering as my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in 2008 from Colegio de Dagupan. Where among engineering subjects, there were those which tackled: Turbo C/C++, Arduino, HTML and web, and Java. There were projects that also needed coding: LED Matrix using Great Cow BASIC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I graduated and passed the Electronics Engineering board exams in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
