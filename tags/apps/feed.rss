      <title>Developing for Apple Soon</title>

      <description>Apple User -&amp;gt; Me Yes, I gave in to use an Apple device. Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried an iPhone XS before, and I must admit, having a device with software dedicated to its hardware is chef&amp;rsquo;s kiss. That&amp;rsquo;s what I liked about Apple, the hardware and software work along each other, and like most people, the price-tag for their phones held me back until December.
I loaned for an iPhone 11 since the iPhone 12 is expensive and I like the 11&amp;rsquo;s grip instead of the sharp edges of the new design.</description>

      <description>The Pandemic and Night Owls My app, ZIP Code PH, has been available on Google Play Store for more than a year now and because of the pandemic, more and more people are staying at home and are mostly night-owls.
And app and software developers are now giving their projects dark mode - not just to follow accessibility standards but offer an option for people to reduce or avoid eye strain.</description>

      <title>RPN Radio: Streaming App for Android</title>

      <description>This should just be a short post to promote and showcase this Android app I developed for my job.
AM Radio in your Pocket Choose from RPN&amp;rsquo;s (Radio Philippines Network) 12 regional AM stations to tune into. Just connect to the internet and be updated to the latest news, talks, and enjoy some old and new tunes.
Development I tried making this app using Xamarin.Forms but the new Android implementation of the media notification sucked a** that I made the app in pure Android Java code.</description>

      <description>Over these past few months, I have been checking on some fluent design concepts and app updates over Twitter and other design sites like, Dribbble, Behance, and even Medium. Also, I have been busy gaming and doing some reading on my spare time that I missed coding and updating some of my apps.
Then one time, I just found the urge to update it after seeing Michael West&amp;rsquo;s concept layouts over Dribbble.</description>

      <title>Your Phone Tray V2</title>

      <description>Your Phone Tray UWP app just got updated.
Version 2.0 brings few UI changes, some improvements and a breaking change.
Improvements To improve the app, I updated the tray icon context menu to show that it should be running on Startup (see Task Manager Start up) You can also see a new menu item Enable Ctrl+Y Hotkey. If enabled, the app silently picks up the Ctrl+Y shortcut to open Your Phone app.</description>

      <title>RPN Android App</title>

      <description>Hey hey, recently I branched out my C# and apps knowledge to create and actually port or make versions of my UWP apps to Android using Xamarin Forms.
Finally opt-in and registered to Google Play platform and chose RPN News &amp;amp; Radio to the Store as the first app (under my registered dev name) to become publicly available.
Obviously, this is unofficial and not backed by my employers. I believe having this in the store is essential to expand the platforms reached by RPN.</description>

      <title>RF Tools Gets Multi-Window Support</title>

      <description>UWP SDK recently released a new support for Multi-windowing.
Then I though of which of my apps should I implement this with, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing better than RF Tools, a calculator app for engineers and enthusiasts of radio frequency.
This should improve the user&amp;rsquo;s experience by doing multiple calculations visible at once; to compare and serve as a history.
You can download the app here</description>
