<p>The app is now available for iPhones. See the <a href="#download-here">download section</a> below.</p>
<hr >
<p>It&rsquo;s been a while again since my last post but there were no significant updates lately - besides another week-long vacation. So let me introduce this new mobile app from RPN that I developed and releasing now.</p>
<h1 id="delays">Delays</h1>
<p>The app had a working beta for Android devices for awhile now with bare experience and a better update has been in the works. I took the time to work out the database functions, UI and UX, and some other features (mobile ads, and customized links).</p>
<p>I apologize for the delay but I just made sure these features are working for production.</p>
<h1 id="app-details">App Details</h1>
<p>Most brands nowadays accompany their line of business with a mobile app, beside the <a href="https://tunein.rpnradio.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RPN Radio app</a> which was released so much earlier, I am now finally be able to bring news mobile app for Android devices, and iPhones.</p>
<p>Right now, the app is a feed for the provincial news as visible on <a href="https://rpnradio.com/category/provincial-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RPN website</a>. The news are gathered by our provincial/regional news stations that you can read from the website or from the app - for much easier reading and sharing.</p>
<h1 id="screenshots">Screenshots</h1>
<p>It took too long to release the app that the version is now at 2.1. Below are screenshots (store previews for iPhone and Android).</p>
