    <title>Upgrade! Samsung 970 EVO Plus</title>

            </div><p>Here we go again folks! Another PC upgrade, this time we take our storage to the next level.</p>
<h1 id="top-player">Top Player</h1>
<p>I just bought a Samsung 970 EVO Plus, 1TB for my &ldquo;coding needs&rdquo;. I recently experience a throttle while using my current XPG 500GB - I have been using some Virtual Machines lately to test out some things, and the SSD space gets loaded up quickly.</p>
<p>The SSD costs me around US$100 and failed to get a cheaper one since I am not paying the whole price - again, I got this for credit. ðŸ˜…</p>
<h1 id="samsung-why">Samsung, why?</h1>
<p>Samsung has been the top brand for SSDs and I can say this myself since personally, I used an 860 EVO in the past for my laptop. And even though my current XPG SSD does it&rsquo;s job, I needed an storage upgrade and it&rsquo;s time to get this one.</p>
<p>The technical specs and comparison is available in the internet which you can visit on PCWorld, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3334876/samsung-970-evo-plus-review-samsungs-entry-level-nvme-ssd-is-faster-and-cheaper.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung 970 EVO Plus review</a></p>
<h1 id="take-a-look">Take a Look</h1>
<p>I forgot to take pictures to avoid the SSD from picking up some static from my desk mat. But I did take a picture of the box before installing it on the system.</p>

    <title>Finally! Logitech C922</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/the-logitech-c922/</link>
    <pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 23:17:51 &#43;0800</pubDate><dc:creator>David</dc:creator><guid>https://reddavid.me/the-logitech-c922/</guid>

                <img src="/images/feat/logitech-c922.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>Yoo! I finally got the C922 PRO HD Webcam from Logitech after wishing having it for years.</p>
<p>Honestly, I bought the camera in a slightly higher price due to the model being out of stock in major stores and just got from a &ldquo;hoarder&rdquo; in Facebook marketplace. :) Harsh but true.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get into my short blog/review/impression about this industry-standard in semi-professional streaming.</p>
<br/>
<h1 id="wait">Wait</h1>
<p>You might ask, why only now? At first, I never really thought of having a good webcam as a small streamer, and I also have this app on my Android phone which makes my Nokia 7 Plus pose as a webcam. Then, I wanted the camera to be positioned well, so I bought a cheaper Logitech, the C270.</p>
<figure class="image">

  <figcaption><em>Logitech C270 Webcam</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>The C270 suited my needs - stream just now and then, and it&rsquo;s just right for video calls and conferencing. The only problem with this one is it has a bad exposure. I used the C270 for almost 3 months until I got the money to buy the beast of a camera, that is the C922.</p>
<br/>
<h1 id="lets-see-922-it">Let&rsquo;s See (922) It</h1>
<p>I opened a brand new Logitech C922 way way before but it wasn&rsquo;t mine, so I already know the contents (alibi for not having pictures after unboxing ðŸ˜‚). And I also tried the unit itself so I knew the quality it brings.</p>
<p>The box contains the C922 camera, a table-top tripod, manuals and a sheet containing the free 3-month XSplit Premium codes (Again, sorry for not having pictures).</p>
<figure class="image">

  <figcaption><em>Logitech C922 Box</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<h1 id="quick-marketing-specs">Quick (marketing) specs</h1>
<p>I won&rsquo;t dive deep into the webcam&rsquo;s specifications like weight and dimensions but here are the common &ldquo;marketing&rdquo; specs that will actually make you consider buying one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capture 1080p @ 30fps, or</li>
<li>720p @ 60fps</li>
<li>Auto focus</li>
<li>Wide Field of View</li>
<li>Advanced camera software</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h1 id="ha-mountable">Ha! Mountable</h1>
<p>The C922 has a screw hole for mounting onto a tripod. The tripod can be extended up to 18.5cm. Here&rsquo;s the closed tripod in three max lengths (with regards to the feet extensions).</p>
<figure class="image">

<figure class="image">


  <figcaption><em>Logitech C922 Tripod</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>The C922 also has a built-in microphone but most people, including me, advice to use an external mic instead.</p>
<br/>
<h1 id="logitech-capture">Logitech Capture</h1>
<p>Upon connecting the webcam to my PC, Logitech prompted to install the companion software - Logitech Capture. The software is advanced enough for my needs - I can zoom and pan, flip the captured video horizontally and/or vertically, choose to prefer exposure or framerate, and most importantly the capture resolutions.</p>
<figure class="image">

  <figcaption><em>Logitech Capture Software</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>The software provides templates for typical sizes: FHD, 720p, and 360p; Portrait: 1080x1920, 720x1280, 360x640; and Squares: 1080x1080, 720x720, and 360x360.</p>
<figure class="image">

  <figcaption><em>Logitech Capture Software - Resolution Options</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>The software also allows you to add effects, text, etc with the Effects menu: Watermark, Text Overlay, Scene effects, Color borders, and Transitions for 2 scenes.</p>
<figure class="image">

</figure>
<br/>
<h1 id="minor-issues">Minor Issues</h1>
<p>There are a couple of issues for me, the first one really makes me annoyed is that I cannot turn off the hotkeys for the software and I have a frameless monitor which mounting the camera is a pain in the a$$ to keep it from covering up the display - even for just a centimeter.</p>
<figure class="image">

<br/>
<h1 id="its-great">It&rsquo;s Great!</h1>
<p>Overall, I am happy with the C922 webcam - my loved ones can see me clearly during video calls. And I thank everybody for supporting me on my <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG/" target="_blank">stream</a>, visiting my website, and checking my Windows 10 apps.</p>

<p>To finish this blog post, let&rsquo;s all stay safe during the pandemic - and even after the pandemic.</p>

    <title>New Keeb in Town</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/new-keeb/</link>
    <pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2020 19:56:25 &#43;0800</pubDate><dc:creator>David</dc:creator><guid>https://reddavid.me/new-keeb/</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/feat/tecware.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>This is a simple review and unboxing post for my newly bought keyboard today. It is the Tecware Phantom Elite TKL with Gateron brown switches. I am using it to write this post.</p>
<p>I have used a number of mechanical keyboards in the past, the first one was an Aula one with Outemu blues. Then a TKL with blue Gateron switches, I forgot the brand, but it&rsquo;s also Chinese. And my slightly premium keyboards, the Logitech G403 and the G810.</p>
<p>The G810 was a stay-at-home keyboard for my laptop and the G403 lives in the office. And guess what, both are defective with unresponsive and ghosting keys, respectively. I thought of delaying buying a new one for &ldquo;budget&rdquo; reasons but coding with keyboard issues is a definitely a pain in the ass with constant deleting doubling keys and characters. I am looking for several &ldquo;budget&rdquo; keyboards out there, including the TNC Icarus one with Cherry MXs but the delivery time was so bad that I had to settle down with this one.</p>
<p>Coming from Logitech, I almost passed on this one for its &ldquo;gamer&rdquo; font which I don&rsquo;t think is <em>clean</em> for my desk, but my wallet said &ldquo;it&rsquo;s okay, you can live with that&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I bought one with brown switches since the old ones I had had Romer-Gs with a &ldquo;mushy-tactile&rdquo; feel on keypress so I don&rsquo;t have to worry much about them on the long run.</p>
</br>
<h1>My thoughts</h1>
<p>The box looks premium with minimal print of the logo and keyboard model on the center.</p>
<figure class="image">

  <figcaption><em>Keyboard box</em></figcaption>
</figure>
</br>
<p>Inside the box was the keyboard wrapped in plastic? with a keyboard cover made of plastic again, on top. It also came with 4 extra switches and a switch puller.</p>
<figure class="image">

</figure>
</br>
<figure class="image">

  <figcaption><em>Extra switches with puller</em></figcaption>
</figure>
</br>
<p>The keyboard has a TKL layout, with software-customizable RGB setting, and replaceable switches (modular). It costs php2,500, slightly costier than their Tecware Phantoms - I&rsquo;m yet to investigate why.</p>
<figure class="image">

  <figcaption><em>Tecware RGB software</em></figcaption>
</figure>
</br>
<p>About the &ldquo;gamer&rdquo; font I hated, this game with a cleaner font. Surprised am I! Though the printing of the keycaps has the &ldquo;stencil&rdquo; cut beneath that the LED does not shine that much. Guess I&rsquo;m okay after all. Some function keys, has this cheap white printing that I fear them to get scraped off some time soon.</p>
<figure class="image">

  <figcaption><em>The keyboard itself</em></figcaption>
</figure>
</br>
<p>The RGB lighting is good with bunch of built-in modes which can be visualized and edited using their software. Here&rsquo;s what it looks like in an unlit office desk.</p>
<figure class="image">

</figure>
</br>
<p>I went ahead for a typing test and got a 76wpm results with no mistyped words. But let&rsquo;s see how long this budget badboy keyboard lasts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all, just a short review and unboxing post for the internet people to see. If you want me to have a typing test and sound test for it, let me know.</p>
<p>Also, my apps are still available in the <a href="ms-windows-store:publisher?name=Red David" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a> and some in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=5465762079490576029" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a>, where I mostly get my funds for buying these stuff. You can always check them out, they&rsquo;re free to download and use, you don&rsquo;t have to buy or pay the the listed price - unless you want to.</p>

    <title>Story of my Logitech Mice</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/story-of-owning-logitech-mice/</link>
    <pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 00:00:00 &#43;0000</pubDate><dc:creator>David</dc:creator><guid>https://reddavid.me/story-of-owning-logitech-mice/</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/07-20/logi-hero.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>Why do (or did) I own at least 5 of Logitech G mice despite the &ldquo;double-clicking&rdquo; issues about them? As an ECE, I knew that some percentage of any electronics produced out there do have flaws - and this is not an excuse for their price - but in the &ldquo;real&rdquo; world, these things can happen. Also, when looking at r/mechanicalkeyboards they combo their awesome keebs with a Logitech mouse despite them hating on Romer-G&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>This is my &ldquo;short&rdquo; history on my Logitech mouse shopping and usage. Here it goes:</p>
<p>If I recall correctly, my first mouse from Logitech was the G302, it has the odd shape but it just fits nicely in my hand. I used it for almost 2 years until it went &ldquo;double-clicking&rdquo; due to playing Dota 2. I just scavenged some old A4tech mouse and took out the switches (Huanos?) to replace one on the G302. The G302 still works today but it has this rattling noise due to the broken plastics inside.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I bought a G203, a smaller mouse sporting with the new logo. I bought this to have an RGB mouse. This is when I started to jump on the &ldquo;Logitech mouse hype&rdquo;.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Being on the &ldquo;hype train&rdquo;, I impulse bought a G403 when it became available in my country despite my current G203 still works. The G403 was not comfortable for my hand - well, the shops before don&rsquo;t have demo units - so I bought another G203 as I gave the old one to my GF for office use. The G403 is stored for now.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After some time, GF&rsquo;s workplace decided to renovate so I took the G203 back and decided to &ldquo;mod&rdquo; it and cut the wire too short making it unroutable to my home setup. This older G203 is now in my &ldquo;junk box&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I think all through the year 2019, I was looking to buy their wireless mouse - the G304. It has the same shape as the G203 and has the new HERO sensor. And that one time when I decided to finally buy one, I first asked a salesperson if there were any Logitech promos and I was told that the G Pro was 50% off. Without hesitation, I bought it instead of the G304.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The G Pro is physically the same as G203 but has a braided cable, stiffer mouse wheel, and sporting the PMW3366 optical gaming sensor. I use this in the office with a cheap mouse bungee to keep the wire neat.</p>
<p>Fast forward March 2020, city-wide was on lockdown, knowing that I would be staying in the office for quite some time, I lend my laptop to my GF for her to use. I also lend her the (working) G203.</p>
<p>After some time staying in the office, I decided to neat up my desk and I found it a hassle for wires (with dual monitors, keyboards, USB cords, and whatnot) so I thought, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to check that G304 I wished for the longest time. And there&rsquo;s a sale incoming too.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I checked Lazada but I was skeptical to buy electronics from them â€“ to avoid the hassle process of returning a defective product. This is when I learned that my &ldquo;favorite&rdquo; gaming store I bought my previous Logitech mice has a &ldquo;better&rdquo; website and I checked the G304 and it was cheaper compared to its store retail price. I bought it as a gift for myself this June.</p>
<p>Here on my desk right now is the G304 and the G Pro. I use the G304 for daily work and casual games and the G Pro for FPS and competitive gaming. I will be posting my review for the G304 soon. And sorry for the lack of better pictures of my mice.</p>

    <title>I Got Myself a New Laptop</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/new-laptop/</link>
    <pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2020 16:30:40 &#43;0800</pubDate><dc:creator>David</dc:creator><guid>https://reddavid.me/new-laptop/</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/feat/acer-laptop.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>Last February 15, I got myself a new Acer laptop. It is an Acer Nitro 5 laptop sporting an AMD Ryzen 3550H with RX560X Graphics. This makes my 3rd Acer laptop in a span of 8+ years and my first ever AMD on a laptop (had an AMD Athlon X2 PC before).</p>
<p>This laptop costs Php34,999 and we could not find a promo since every store follows the retail price. Although, the laptop was <em>on promo</em> with having an included a single stick of 8GB DDR4 memory (upgraded from 4GB), 128GB SSD (m.2 SATA) and a 1TB mechanical drive (not SSHD).</p>
<p>The laptop includes a generic-looking backpack - yes, I said generic since I saw somewhere that there is a <em>gaming-accented</em> version of the bag.</p>
</br>
<h1 id="some-quick-specs">Some quick specs:</h1>
<ul>
<li>AMD Ryzen 5 3550H Quad-Core with Vega 8 Graphics (which consumes 2GB of RAM)</li>
<li>AMD Radeon RX560X 4GB DDR4 - Here&rsquo;s the catch, upon checking CPU-Z the - installed memory stick is rated at 2666MHz but later found out that Ryzen 3550H is limited to 2400MHz, so maybe that is a bummer</li>
<li>15.6&quot; FHD 1920x1080p IPS LCD(slim-frame), Red Backlit-keyboard</li>
<li>Dual M.2 (nVME only + SATA only) + 1 HDD slots</li>
</ul>
<p>Full specs of the laptop can be found <a href="https://www.acer.com/ac/en/GB/content/model/NH.Q5XEK.008">here</a></p>
</br>
<h1 id="using-the-laptop">Using the laptop</h1>
<h3 id="speed">Speed</h3>
<p>Coming from an Intel i7 laptop, I felt the difference in boot up times, booting on this device is slightly slower - not sure if it&rsquo;s because of the SSD installed since I was using a Samsung 860 Evo on my old laptop.</p>
<p>Next is using Visual Studio, rebuilding some of my apps takes a longer time to finish. Also, having only 6GB of memory (since the 2GB is shared to CPU?) I can&rsquo;t stand having my chrome tabs reload after a while.</p>
<h3 id="gaming">Gaming</h3>
<p>Before my old laptop broke (which was an Acer Nitro V, with an Intel i7 4th gen + 2GB GTX960M), I was just playing some Minecraft (sometimes with Shaders), some casual Dota 2, and other medium-intensive games.</p>
<p>Of course, I was playing either inside an aircon-ed room or the fan pointing to the laptop.</p>
<p>Meanwhile on this new laptop, launching games, even Dota 2, was a pain. It took too long that sometimes it would just not respond and fails to load at all.</p>
<p>But before even buying this, I said to myself that I can&rsquo;t game like I did before - long hours, intensive AAA games - so I disregarded this experience, at first.</p>
<h3 id="overall-system-experience">Overall (System) Experience</h3>
<p>Out of habit, I installed the latest drivers including Radeon software (Adrenaline 2020). But the app is laggy as hell and eventually gave me a black screen out of nowhere - which I made a hard boot just to go back seeing things to Windows.</p>
<p>Upon checking, it installed an older driver. (Damn AMD)</p>
<p>Even though I use an external mech keyboard, this keyboard layout is hideous compared to the old Nitro V I had! I am missing the Pause/Break key but I believe it is hidden in F11, I believe.</p>
<p>The ports are ok, but the Type-C is not thunderbolt. The power port is on the middle of the body!!!</p>
<p>Nitro Sense is a great addition that it lets you control the laptop fans manually - they can get loud man! The fan layout is not &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; in my opinion though.</p>
<p>Lastly, the speakers on it are s**t ðŸ¤®.</p>
</br>
<h1 id="upgrades">Upgrades!!!</h1>
<p>It took me two weeks to &ldquo;settle&rdquo; with this new laptop and sometimes got me thinking of &ldquo;regrets&rdquo;. But I actually planned to upgrade memory - I just didn&rsquo;t have the money ðŸ˜‚.</p>
<p>I got an 8GB TeamGroup stick 2666MHz despite the CPU limit since I can re-use them (on future units or resell them), and the price difference to a 2400MHz is minimal.</p>
<p>The unit has not easy-access so I went to a service center to install the RAM together with my old WD 500GB SSD just to have an &ldquo;extra&rdquo; faster storage. The service was free, and it took only 30 minutes because of some papers to fill-out but the service was fast.</p>
<p>The unit was faster, and launching apps and games was indeed faster. I also got extra fps in games, saved seconds to minutes in Visual Studio, and Chrome tabs are saved.</p>
<p>The only problem here now is having an older, OEM-issued drivers for the graphics card.</p>
<p>Replaying some games with higher FPS is also a plus.</p>
<p>Right now, I am thinking of upgrading to nVMe, to a higher 2.5&quot; SSD and 32GB RAM ðŸ˜³.</p>
