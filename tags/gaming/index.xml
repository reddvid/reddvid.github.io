            </div><p>Okay, hear me out, I am still procrastinating after watching hours TED Talks and YouTube videos on how to be productive and avoid wasting time doing senseless things. What&rsquo;s wrong? Do I have a lot on my mind or in my hands to keep me posting blogs? Can&rsquo;t be motivated by self-help books and videos? Am I still waiting for when &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too late&rdquo;? AARGH</p>
<p></p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h1 id="hunyo">Hunyo</h1>
<p>So my last post was June 12, I celebrated my 29th birthday on the 14th and got me self an Elgato HD60S+ to achieve better mobile gaming mirroring but that still, I can&rsquo;t keep my streaming schedule! AARGH (2)</p>
<p>I got the thingy not just to stream games but for future use - like recording &ldquo;How to use this app&rdquo; for YouTube or presentations, so it may be an expensive thing but I always think of them as investment for my app development journey.</p>

<p>Speaking of streaming, I started streaming on Twitch! Right now, I planned on playing Minecraft, Left 4 Dead 2, and Call of Duty: Mobile. Also, I will try to stream on MWFS schedule playing those games or variety. <a href="https://twitch.tv/RedDavidGG" target="_blank">Give me a follow</a> and get notified when I go live.</p>
<p>I will be using my <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG" target="_blank">Facebook Page</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/rKnJb4J" target="_blank">Discord server</a> to post updates.</p>
<h3 id="stream-setup-mobile-gaming">Stream Setup (Mobile Gaming)</h3>
<p>As of this writing, I am lucky enough to have this setup for mobile game streaming:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://shp.ee/znd3exz" target="_blank">Apple iPhone 11</a></li>
<li><a href="https://shp.ee/ta83sar" target="_blank">Elgato HD60S+ Capture Card</a></li>

<li><a href="https://shp.ee/m3dktiz" target="_blank">SteelSeries Arctis 1</a></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Any more happened last week of June? Hmm. Yeah right, I released an update for RPN Radio app for both Android and iOS adding a call-to-action button to send the stations a message thru Facebook Messenger. This was after watching on Udemy that apps or any products always have a goal-in-mind - the stations should increase inquiries for advertisement or any other public service comments.</p>
<p>The app is still available for <strong>FREE</strong> on Google Play Store, Huawei App Store, and iOS App Store. I created this simple app landing page for the <a href="https://tunein.rpnradio.com/download" target="_blank">links.</a></p>

<p>I also got to try the new <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11" target="_blank">Windows 11 Insider Preview</a> on a VM. Tested on my main machine but I can&rsquo;t risk the beta so I rolled back to Windows 10.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start the month with a sweet treat, homemade chocolates courtesy of my SO. Anyone interested? Hit the like on the Instagram post below for us to start selling them. üòä</p>

<p>I got my second dose of Covid vaccine (Sinovac) on the 6th, thankfully there were no side-effects except for the body aches I got after NOT SLEEPING WELL! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
<p>With work, I updated the <a href="https://rpnradio.com" target="_blank">RPN website</a> overall layout after migrating to a new hosting provider. And some minor updates to some if not all the online systems.</p>

<p>After that, I decided to take a <del>short</del> long break to escape the <del>jungle</del> NCR Bubble by going home to Pangasinan. I am so longing to be with the family after 6+ months of not going home - I went home last December 2020 to spend the holidays.</p>
<p>I was so looking forward to at least visit a beach, see a sunset, feel the breeze of fresh air but UNLUCKILY the weather ahead was not well! I did not see the predictions that there will be a coming storm for the week. So the first few days were a bust, and I just stayed inside and chilled out with some beer.</p>
<p>The 20th was a holiday, and magically the weather was at least fine for us to go to Binmaley beach - don&rsquo;t worry, there were no crowds so we can be safe, I think? The sun was peeping through the clouds and by the afternoon, a mild rain poured. Together with relatives, we spend some time there swimming, singing, EATING, and drinking booze until it&rsquo;s time to go home.</p>

<p>My other plans went down the drain as the weather became worse, Dagupan City was flooded (plus high tide) that light vehicles weren&rsquo;t able to pass. Sadly, I can&rsquo;t meet my <del>only</del> city friends. There&rsquo;s still next time right? Right?</p>
<p>I decided to extend my stay but continued checking some online responsibilities just to make sure they are still up even I&rsquo;m not present in the office - though I failed to join our online meetings.</p>
<p>We also went to our grandfather&rsquo;s brother to celebrate his 70th birthday. Then we spent some time (and over pizza) with my cousin to talk about tech and stuff.</p>

<p>Oh, I also got a haircut (question mark).</p>

    <title>Streaming Again &amp; Minecraft SMP Season 2</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/minecraft-smp-season-2/</link>
    <pubDate>Sun, 18 Apr 2021 02:52:30 &#43;0800</pubDate><dc:creator>David</dc:creator><guid>https://reddavid.me/minecraft-smp-season-2/</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/feat/mc-smp-s02.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>Rejoice! My more-than-a-month-long hiatus finally came to an end - I&rsquo;m back to streaming video games in Facebook Gaming. In just 2 days, I&rsquo;ve managed to garner a whopping 8+ hours as compared before.</p>
<p>This also means that I am back to relieving some stress thru my beloved game Minecraft, (Survival Mode).</p>
<h1 id="first-world">First World?</h1>
<p>The first server I rented became <strike>toxic</strike> unenjoyable after a few months after opening it into the public - NO it&rsquo;s not because of the new players, but because the server was technically &ldquo;DONE&rdquo; by having usable XP farms, stripped mines, food source, and other auto AFK farms. Which meant that new players have nothing more to do but mess around most of the time.</p>
<p>I tried to reload the server with a new world but it kept corrupting upto the point that I reverted it back to the older (toxic) world. And I stopped playing less and less.</p>
<h1 id="refreshed-and-new-season-two">Refreshed and New? SEASON TWO</h1>
<p>Yes, after I decided to stream again, I hastily rented a new server and invite some of my OG followers to play with me. As of now, the world is still peaceful and managed to invite more players in hoping we can live happily in the upcoming days.</p>
<p>Unlike before, the server is now Offline-mode, meaning that non-Mojang accounts can now join - be CAREFUL though, WE CAN STILL <strong>BAN</strong> YOU.</p>
<h2 id="wanna-join">Wanna join?</h2>
<p>Head over to our Discord server for the rules and guidelines, and for the Server IP.</p>

<p>Hosted by Shockbyte, cheap and reliable servers are offered for you. Check them out <a href="https://bit.ly/ShockByteMC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<h1 id="hello-1k-followers">Hello 1K Followers</h1>
<p>I have been aiming to reach followers before the year 2020 ends but I failed to do so, much more that I stopped streaming for more than a month.</p>
<p>Now with regained confidence, I am on the path to reach that goal while improving my streaming. So head over to my <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook Gaming Page</a> and see if you like me to gain a Follow!</p>
<h1 id="looking-for-support">‚ú®Looking for Support</h1>
<p>Also, I tried streaming mobile games now and then but the current setup is not suited for it. I am slowly building funds to get the setup for mobile games too.</p>

    <title>Logitech G304 Review</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/g304-review/</link>
    <pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2020 23:42:58 &#43;0800</pubDate><dc:creator>David</dc:creator><guid>https://reddavid.me/g304-review/</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/feat/g304.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>So this is my short and honest review of the G304 wireless mouse.</p>
<p>As I mentioned on my previous blog post <a href="/story-of-owning-logitech-mice/">here</a>, this is my 4th mouse and my first gaming? wireless mouse. I ordered it online from DataBlitz for $39, and was delivered quickly in 2 days.</p>
<br/>
<h1 id="whats-in-the-box">What&rsquo;s in the box?</h1>
<p>The box contains the wireless mouse itself, the usual manuals, Logitech Gaming promo leaflet, a blue G logo sticker, a Duracell AA battery, and a USB extension cord.</p>

<br/>
<h1 id="lets-get-physical">Let&rsquo;s get Physical!</h1>
<p>The mouse has no RGB strip like it&rsquo;s cousins (G Pro/G203) but it has a single RGB LED that indicates colored DPI assignments in Logitech G Hub. The battery compartment and the USB receiver is accessed through the lower top part of the mouse - by sliding it off the body.</p>

<p>I currently use an Energizer Lithium AA battery which I believe is lighter but I still keep the free battery whenever I need a heavier setup.</p>

<p>The power switch is located below the mouse with a red and blue color indicator for off and on state. The bottom also has an extra slide compared to the G Pro/G203.</p>

<p>The mouse shape fits perfectly in my hands and I can switch to the wired G Pro when I play some competitive games - not that this can&rsquo;t do the job. But I often stick to this, G304, every time I stream my games (shameless plug - <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG/</a>)</p>
 

<br/>
<h1 id="reliability">Reliability</h1>
<p>I used this since day one - June 2 - and I only got a hiccup once during a Dota 2 game which made me switch to wired, and since then I used this as a daily driver and on my games. Lately, I am playing Minecraft a lot, some Dota 2, CS:GO, some Valorant, Metro Exodus, just finished Mafia II: Definitive Edition, C&amp;C Yuri&rsquo;s Revenge.</p>
<br/>
<h1 id="verdict-at-last">Verdict, at last</h1>
<p>My overall experience using the same shape of a mouse will be just comfortable throughout my day - office job and being a small-time streamer. It also frees your hand positions by not limited by a wired mouse. Despite it not having an RGB, I would suggest this for small-handed people, for those who travel a lot and for gamers and streamers looking for a budget wireless gaming mouse.</p>
<br/>
<h1 id="more-info">More info?</h1>
<p>Since I don&rsquo;t have a weighing scale and sea of tech reviews, you can check the thorough tech specs review from Rocket Jump Ninja <a href="https://www.rocketjumpninja.com/products/mouse/logitech-g305" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
