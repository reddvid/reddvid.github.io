      <description>It was early 2019, I think when I accidentally deleted my Wordpress database that contains at least 20 posts. Sad right? After that sad moment, I tried to repost everything using Hugo, a static website builder, but found that it was too complicated - with YAML, some .scss, layouts, etc.
So I gave up and made a basic website with just HTML, CSS, and JS files. It was ok for me, just having a landing page for my apps, other works and a short bio.</description>

      <description>UWP SDK recently released a new support for Multi-windowing.
&amp;ldquo;UWP multiview&amp;rdquo;Then I though of which of my apps should I implement this with, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing better than RF Tools, a calculator app for engineers and enthusiasts of radio frequency.
This should improve the user&amp;rsquo;s experience by doing multiple calculations visible at once; to compare and serve as a history.
&amp;ldquo;RF Tools split view&amp;rdquo;&amp;ldquo;RF Tools multi window&amp;rdquo;You can download the app here</description>

      <title>A Story of Self-taught Coding</title>

      <description>Started coding using VB.Net and Forms for our final year thesis (which programming was NOT a major). Then while gearing up for board exams, learnt to code and design for Windows Phone 7.5/7.8/8 using XAML, C# &amp;amp; Silverlight.
Then came Windows 8.1 and WP8.1 on the Univeral App Shared codes, but didn&amp;rsquo;t dive that deep because of some weird Windows 8.1 windowing and such.
Finally W10 and UWP, still slowly learning and managed to improve my coding skills.</description>
