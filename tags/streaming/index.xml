    <title>Roundup: July. And June</title>

            </div><p>Okay, hear me out, I am still procrastinating after watching hours TED Talks and YouTube videos on how to be productive and avoid wasting time doing senseless things. What&rsquo;s wrong? Do I have a lot on my mind or in my hands to keep me posting blogs? Can&rsquo;t be motivated by self-help books and videos? Am I still waiting for when &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too late&rdquo;? AARGH</p>
<p></p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h1 id="hunyo">Hunyo</h1>
<p>So my last post was June 12, I celebrated my 29th birthday on the 14th and got me self an Elgato HD60S+ to achieve better mobile gaming mirroring but that still, I can&rsquo;t keep my streaming schedule! AARGH (2)</p>
<p>I got the thingy not just to stream games but for future use - like recording &ldquo;How to use this app&rdquo; for YouTube or presentations, so it may be an expensive thing but I always think of them as investment for my app development journey.</p>

<p>Speaking of streaming, I started streaming on Twitch! Right now, I planned on playing Minecraft, Left 4 Dead 2, and Call of Duty: Mobile. Also, I will try to stream on MWFS schedule playing those games or variety. <a href="https://twitch.tv/RedDavidGG" target="_blank">Give me a follow</a> and get notified when I go live.</p>
<p>I will be using my <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG" target="_blank">Facebook Page</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/rKnJb4J" target="_blank">Discord server</a> to post updates.</p>
<h3 id="stream-setup-mobile-gaming">Stream Setup (Mobile Gaming)</h3>
<p>As of this writing, I am lucky enough to have this setup for mobile game streaming:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://shp.ee/znd3exz" target="_blank">Apple iPhone 11</a></li>
<li><a href="https://shp.ee/ta83sar" target="_blank">Elgato HD60S+ Capture Card</a></li>
<li><a href="https://shp.ee/uw5zqsr" target="_blank">Audio-Technica ATR-2500X</a></li>
<li><a href="https://shp.ee/m3dktiz" target="_blank">SteelSeries Arctis 1</a></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Any more happened last week of June? Hmm. Yeah right, I released an update for RPN Radio app for both Android and iOS adding a call-to-action button to send the stations a message thru Facebook Messenger. This was after watching on Udemy that apps or any products always have a goal-in-mind - the stations should increase inquiries for advertisement or any other public service comments.</p>
<p>The app is still available for <strong>FREE</strong> on Google Play Store, Huawei App Store, and iOS App Store. I created this simple app landing page for the <a href="https://tunein.rpnradio.com/download" target="_blank">links.</a></p>
<figure><figcaption>

<p>I also got to try the new <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11" target="_blank">Windows 11 Insider Preview</a> on a VM. Tested on my main machine but I can&rsquo;t risk the beta so I rolled back to Windows 10.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1 id="hulyo">Hulyo</h1>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start the month with a sweet treat, homemade chocolates courtesy of my SO. Anyone interested? Hit the like on the Instagram post below for us to start selling them. üòä</p>

<p>I got my second dose of Covid vaccine (Sinovac) on the 6th, thankfully there were no side-effects except for the body aches I got after NOT SLEEPING WELL! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
<p>With work, I updated the <a href="https://rpnradio.com" target="_blank">RPN website</a> overall layout after migrating to a new hosting provider. And some minor updates to some if not all the online systems.</p>

<p>After that, I decided to take a <del>short</del> long break to escape the <del>jungle</del> NCR Bubble by going home to Pangasinan. I am so longing to be with the family after 6+ months of not going home - I went home last December 2020 to spend the holidays.</p>
<p>I was so looking forward to at least visit a beach, see a sunset, feel the breeze of fresh air but UNLUCKILY the weather ahead was not well! I did not see the predictions that there will be a coming storm for the week. So the first few days were a bust, and I just stayed inside and chilled out with some beer.</p>
<p>The 20th was a holiday, and magically the weather was at least fine for us to go to Binmaley beach - don&rsquo;t worry, there were no crowds so we can be safe, I think? The sun was peeping through the clouds and by the afternoon, a mild rain poured. Together with relatives, we spend some time there swimming, singing, EATING, and drinking booze until it&rsquo;s time to go home.</p>

</p>
<p>My other plans went down the drain as the weather became worse, Dagupan City was flooded (plus high tide) that light vehicles weren&rsquo;t able to pass. Sadly, I can&rsquo;t meet my <del>only</del> city friends. There&rsquo;s still next time right? Right?</p>
<p>I decided to extend my stay but continued checking some online responsibilities just to make sure they are still up even I&rsquo;m not present in the office - though I failed to join our online meetings.</p>
<p>We also went to our grandfather&rsquo;s brother to celebrate his 70th birthday. Then we spent some time (and over pizza) with my cousin to talk about tech and stuff.</p>

    <title>Mobile Game Streaming</title>

    <pubDate>Sat, 12 Jun 2021 04:26:59 &#43;0800</pubDate><dc:creator>David</dc:creator><guid>https://reddavid.me/mobile-game-streaming/</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/feat/codm-fbgg-streaming.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>This is a post to ask my SMP members to forgive by not playing for a while (a week) on our Minecraft server. I will also share my setup how I stream mobile games.</p>
<h1 id="grind-to-legend">Grind to Legend</h1>
<p>Ever since the new season of Call of Duty: Mobile came out, I just wanted to redeem the legendary medal. And also to get all rewards from the Battle Pass I bought. üòÇ</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry guys and gals, kuya Red will be back soon. Konti na lang back to Legendary rank na sa BR mode at pwede na mag-Minecraft.</p>
<figure><figcaption>
            <h4>Locked Legendary Rank</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h1 id="minecraft-117-is-out">Minecraft 1.17 is out</h1>
<p>Spigot 1.17 is out and is now available as an option for our server but the plugins are currently unsupported, so we&rsquo;ll stick to 1.16.5. Though I played the snapshots and pre-releases, I am still yet to play Minecraft 1.17 Vanilla.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0maWbr0FHKY" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>The caves and cliffs update (part 1) brings new items and features which were detailed on Minecraft&rsquo;s own blog <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/updates/caves-and-cliffs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now on to my setup.</p>
<h1 id="setup">Setup</h1>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s see the devices I use except for the laptop/PC for streaming.</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone 11</li>
<li>Lightning to AV Digital Adapter</li>
<li>HDMI cable</li>
<li>Cheap video capture</li>
<li>Audio-technica Condenser Mic</li>
</ul>
<p>I used to play on my Nokia 7 Plus but can&rsquo;t the specs can&rsquo;t keep up, not sure why. This is when I use <a href="https://www.vysor.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vysor</a>, a screen mirroring app that wirelessly share the phone&rsquo;s screen to the PC. Now, that&rsquo;s where the problem is, wireless mirroring makes the sound delayed that playing action games is not a good experience. I invested in both an iPhone and the adapter since I can use them on future projects - software development.</p>
<figure><figcaption>
            <h4>Lightning to AV Adapter and USB Capture Card</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I wonder why branded capture cards are so damn expensive?! Like the <a href="https://ecommerce.datablitz.com.ph/products/elgato-hd60-s-game-capture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elgato HD60S</a> and <a href="https://ecommerce.datablitz.com.ph/products/avermedia-live-gamer-ultra-game-streaming-capture-box-gc553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AverMedia Live Gamer Ultra</a>. So I went ahead and bought a $6 (300 pesos) unbranded USB capture card and it just works fine. Just stick it well on a USB port and it&rsquo;s good to go.</p>
<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3o6MbtelsDZdsbFB7i" width="480" height="360" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto;"></iframe>
<p>Lastly, I recently bought an <a href="https://www.audio-technica.com/en-gb/atr2500x-usb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ATR-2500X condenser mic</a> to record songs and guitars for my YouTube channel. Now it&rsquo;s multi-purpose that I use it on my streams and Zoom meetings.</p>
<figure><figcaption>
            <h4>Audio-Technica ATR2500X Condenser Mic</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>As for the software, I use <a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OBS Studio</a>. I had a bad experience using SLOBS, it freezes and crashes over simple things. I used to do overlays with Streamlabs but then I found StreamElements OBS.Live. It makes things much easier with a direct &ldquo;Go Live&rdquo; button on OBS Studio, chat box, and activity feed. They also provide a nice overlay editor with text-to-speech system on their <a href="https://streamelements.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>.</p>
<figure><figcaption>
            <h4>StreamElements OBS.Live Plugin</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="diagram">Diagram</h2>
<p>This is how my setup is connected. Remember that you need an internet with at least 4000kbps of upload speed to actually stream your games on Facebook Gaming (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/fbgaminghome/creators/getstarted" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>). I stream at 1080p60 with 6000kbps bitrate.</p>
<figure><figcaption>
            <h4>Hardware Setup Diagram</h4>

</figure>

<h1 id="games-list">Games List</h1>
<p>I have a few mobile games on my phone right now compared to my <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/reddvid/games/?tab=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Library</a>. But I own some mobile-worthy games like Stardew Valley and Minecraft: Pocket Edition.</p>
<p>I have a love and hate relationship with games like PUBG Mobile and Mobile Legends. I am looking forward to Apex Legends: Mobile and Diablo Immortal though. They&rsquo;re both are already in beta preview on Android, currently waiting for the iPhone/iPad version.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.me/reddavidgg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Send me a message</a> to request a game I can play. Or we can play together.</p>
<h1 id="support-me-on-facebook-gaming">Support me on Facebook Gaming</h1>
<p>This seems repetitive but I do need some support when I go live. It feels like streaming and talking to friends is now an everyday duty, haha. But kidding aside, everyone needs help.</p>
<p>Check me <a href="https://fb.gg/reddavidgg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and let&rsquo;s talk more about tech and things.</p>

    <title>OBS Studio 27 is here</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/obs-27-is-here/</link>

                <img src="/images/feat/obs27.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>I just updated my OBS a few days ago with the official release version after trying out the several release candidates.</p>
<p>I will talk about the new features and improvements here that will be useful for my use. Check their blog post <a href="https://obsproject.com/blog/obs-studio-27-released" target="_blank">here</a> and the complete changelog <a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/27.0.0" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
<br>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LUkMxYNIyj0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<br>
<h1 id="undo--redo-5000">Undo &amp; Redo (5000)</h1>
<p>At last! No more annoyances when you just ACCIDENTALLY move something on the canvas. Undo and redo is here for every change you do in your sources and scenes - not sure for all filters though. And that‚Äôs 5000 actions.</p>
<p>Though I mostly use OBS for game streaming (no facecam), I move things around only to notice that it was not the source I wanted to move! This surely helps users out and always had been the most requested feature.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="files-where">Files, where?</h1>
<p>Version 27 also added a missing files window prompt on launch that allows us to relocate or ignore the missing files. Nice addition so we don‚Äôt go start streaming only to have the files missing.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Missing Files Warning Window</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<h1 id="no-more-noise">No More Noise</h1>
<p>OBS v27 for Windows now adds NVIDIA Noise Removal as an option to audio Noise Suppression filter when the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-sdk/resources/" target="_blank">NVIDIA Audio Effects SDK</a> is installed. Oh, also you need an NVIDIA RTX GPU for that - so no screenshots from me.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="improvements">Improvements</h1>
<p>Thanks for these 2 new improvements among others:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browser Source interact button (toolbar)</li>
<li>Virtual Camera toggle button (system tray)</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image">

<br/>
<br>
<h1 id="fin">Fin</h1>
<p>This new version of OBS Studio definitely helps with the new added features. Now I want a selective record feature.</p>
<p>I use OBS Studio together with <a href="https://streamelements.com/" target="_blank">StreamElements</a> OBS Live to simplify my stream setup to Facebook Gaming. I now have 1,019 followers (as of this writing) and why not check me out there? Maybe talk about gaming, life, or programming? <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG/" target="_blank">RedDavidGG on Facebook Gaming</a></p>
<p>I dedicate the starwall page for my stars-sender. Thanks and make sure to check out OBS Studio‚Äôs latest release <a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

    <title>Unlocked: 1K Followers</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/unlocked-1k-followers/</link>
    <pubDate>Sat, 29 May 2021 22:26:48 &#43;0800</pubDate><dc:creator>David</dc:creator><guid>https://reddavid.me/unlocked-1k-followers/</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/feat/1k-followers.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>First of all, thank you so much to all who stayed, watched, and enjoyed my content.</p>
<p>It was on May 26th that we finally got to a thousand following after a year of starting to be a Gaming Video Creator on Facebook. The stream felt like another day of chill streaming by playing a couple of hours of Minecraft. It was quite overwhelming for a small-time (and not full-time) streamer like me but thanks to my cousins and og supporters for helping me out in the chat and Discord server.</p>
<figure class="image">

</figure>
<br/>
<h1 id="strikedailystrike-nightly-streams"><strike>Daily</strike> Nightly Streams</h1>
<p>Now that there&rsquo;s that 1K following behind me, I will pursue to stream on a daily basis, even a short one because honestly, I miss talking and updating with them. I will also continue to improve my stream quality.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="not-minecraft-hello">Not Minecraft, Hello?</h1>
<p>Minecraft is a really popular game we all know that, and most of my followers were because of the game. I do not expect everyone to like me playing variety of games but I still hope most could support me when I come back playing other types of games. Although, I would still join our SMP server if I fail to stream Minecraft.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="twitchyoutube-switch">Twitch/YouTube Switch</h1>
<p>Yes, I have been thinking of switching to either one, why? First, Twitch have several audience interaction which I have been using when I watch my favorite streamers there like, watch points, play with viewers, etc and you can watch on app minimized.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Watch Twitch Videos Minimized</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>While YouTube had a better chat system, but chat highlights and audience interactions are better - with chatbots.</p>
<p>I held back these thoughts before since I did start my Facebook page a long time and gained a few followers. I just hoped if I made up my mind to switch, we can determine the real supporters. Maybe?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for this blog post. Thank you again for visiting my website and you can catch up on my Gaming Videos on <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook Gaming</a> and follower me there. You can also follow me on my socials: @reddvid</p>

    <title>Finally! Logitech C922</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/the-logitech-c922/</link>
    <pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 23:17:51 &#43;0800</pubDate><dc:creator>David</dc:creator><guid>https://reddavid.me/the-logitech-c922/</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/feat/logitech-c922.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>Yoo! I finally got the C922 PRO HD Webcam from Logitech after wishing having it for years.</p>
<p>Honestly, I bought the camera in a slightly higher price due to the model being out of stock in major stores and just got from a &ldquo;hoarder&rdquo; in Facebook marketplace. :) Harsh but true.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get into my short blog/review/impression about this industry-standard in semi-professional streaming.</p>
<br/>
<h1 id="wait">Wait</h1>
<p>You might ask, why only now? At first, I never really thought of having a good webcam as a small streamer, and I also have this app on my Android phone which makes my Nokia 7 Plus pose as a webcam. Then, I wanted the camera to be positioned well, so I bought a cheaper Logitech, the C270.</p>
<figure class="image">

  <figcaption><em>Logitech C270 Webcam</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>The C270 suited my needs - stream just now and then, and it&rsquo;s just right for video calls and conferencing. The only problem with this one is it has a bad exposure. I used the C270 for almost 3 months until I got the money to buy the beast of a camera, that is the C922.</p>
<br/>
<h1 id="lets-see-922-it">Let&rsquo;s See (922) It</h1>
<p>I opened a brand new Logitech C922 way way before but it wasn&rsquo;t mine, so I already know the contents (alibi for not having pictures after unboxing üòÇ). And I also tried the unit itself so I knew the quality it brings.</p>
<p>The box contains the C922 camera, a table-top tripod, manuals and a sheet containing the free 3-month XSplit Premium codes (Again, sorry for not having pictures).</p>
<figure class="image">

  <figcaption><em>Logitech C922 Box</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<h1 id="quick-marketing-specs">Quick (marketing) specs</h1>
<p>I won&rsquo;t dive deep into the webcam&rsquo;s specifications like weight and dimensions but here are the common &ldquo;marketing&rdquo; specs that will actually make you consider buying one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capture 1080p @ 30fps, or</li>
<li>720p @ 60fps</li>
<li>Auto focus</li>
<li>Wide Field of View</li>
<li>Advanced camera software</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h1 id="ha-mountable">Ha! Mountable</h1>
<p>The C922 has a screw hole for mounting onto a tripod. The tripod can be extended up to 18.5cm. Here&rsquo;s the closed tripod in three max lengths (with regards to the feet extensions).</p>
<figure class="image">

<br/>
<p>The tripod, without and with the webcam.</p>
<figure class="image">


  <figcaption><em>Logitech C922 Tripod</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>The C922 also has a built-in microphone but most people, including me, advice to use an external mic instead.</p>
<br/>
<h1 id="logitech-capture">Logitech Capture</h1>
<p>Upon connecting the webcam to my PC, Logitech prompted to install the companion software - Logitech Capture. The software is advanced enough for my needs - I can zoom and pan, flip the captured video horizontally and/or vertically, choose to prefer exposure or framerate, and most importantly the capture resolutions.</p>
<figure class="image">

  <figcaption><em>Logitech Capture Software</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>The software provides templates for typical sizes: FHD, 720p, and 360p; Portrait: 1080x1920, 720x1280, 360x640; and Squares: 1080x1080, 720x720, and 360x360.</p>
<figure class="image">

  <figcaption><em>Logitech Capture Software - Resolution Options</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>The software also allows you to add effects, text, etc with the Effects menu: Watermark, Text Overlay, Scene effects, Color borders, and Transitions for 2 scenes.</p>
<figure class="image">

  <figcaption><em>Logitech Capture Software - Effects Options</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<h1 id="minor-issues">Minor Issues</h1>
<p>There are a couple of issues for me, the first one really makes me annoyed is that I cannot turn off the hotkeys for the software and I have a frameless monitor which mounting the camera is a pain in the a$$ to keep it from covering up the display - even for just a centimeter.</p>
<figure class="image">

  <figcaption><em>Mounting Issue on a Frameless Monitor</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<h1 id="its-great">It&rsquo;s Great!</h1>
<p>Overall, I am happy with the C922 webcam - my loved ones can see me clearly during video calls. And I thank everybody for supporting me on my <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG/" target="_blank">stream</a>, visiting my website, and checking my Windows 10 apps.</p>
<figure class="image">

  <figcaption><em>Mounting is Just Right</em></figcaption>

<br/>
<p>To finish this blog post, let&rsquo;s all stay safe during the pandemic - and even after the pandemic.</p>
