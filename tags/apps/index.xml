            </div><p>It&rsquo;s been a while again since my last post but there were no significant updates lately - besides another week-long vacation. So let me introduce this new mobile app from RPN that I developed and releasing now.</p>
<h1 id="delays">Delays</h1>
<p>The app had a working beta for Android devices for awhile now with bare experience and a better update has been in the works. I took the time to work out the database functions, UI and UX, and some other features (mobile ads, and customized links).</p>
<p>I apologize for the delay but I just made sure these features are working for production.</p>
<h1 id="app-details">App Details</h1>
<p>Most brands nowadays accompany their line of business with a mobile app, beside the <a href="https://tunein.rpnradio.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RPN Radio app</a> which was released so much earlier, I am now finally be able to bring news mobile app for Android devices, and iPhones.</p>
<p>Right now, the app is a feed for the provincial news as visible on <a href="https://rpnradio.com/category/provincial-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RPN website</a>. The news are gathered by our provincial/regional news stations that you can read from the website or from the app - for much easier reading and sharing.</p>
<h1 id="screenshots">Screenshots</h1>
<p>It took too long to release the app that the version is now at 2.1. Below are screenshots (store previews for iPhone and Android).</p>

    <title>My Top Apps for Windows and iPhone</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/my-top-windows-and-mobile-apps/</link>
    <pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 00:45:35 &#43;0800</pubDate><dc:creator>David</dc:creator><guid>https://reddavid.me/my-top-windows-and-mobile-apps/</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/og/apps.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>As you may know by now, I am an electronics engineer but currently and mostly doing IT stuff and some casual gaming. I can also describe myself as an on-a-budget tech enthusiast - I buy top-tier pc/laptop upgrades after some time since their release or when it&rsquo;s affordable enough; like when I went for 1TB Samsung 970 EVO just to hold the apps, games, and files that I leave after testing them out.</p>
<p>Having said that, I sometimes stumble upon bad or corrupted files, deleted some system files, OR EVEN installing Windows sh*ttiest Insider builds. But I seldom hold myself back reverting or reinstalling Windows to clean everything up.</p>
<h2 id="cloud-works">Cloud works</h2>
<p>I trust the cloud, at least with Microsoft&rsquo;s OneDrive service. I have a 1TB subscription with them to hold my most important files (like assets for this website, etc.) and pictures. I also always keep in hand a Windows installer on a USB stick. With all the files are backed up I simply begin reformatting it and reinstall apps/softwares starting with these:</p>
<h1 id="windows-apps">Windows Apps</h1>
<p>This list may or may not be in order.</p>
<h2 id="avast-driver-updater">Avast Driver Updater</h2>
<p>Since Windows 10, the OS also installs drivers but I make sure they are updated using this software. It has a free trial and it works just fine. At this time, I also install graphics drivers (AMD Radeon Software or NVidia GeForce Experience).</p>
<p><strong>Download link: <a href="https://www.avast.com/en-ph/driver-updater#pc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Avast Driver Updater &amp; Scanner</a></strong></p>
<h2 id="microsoft-office">Microsoft Office</h2>
<p>My subscription also contains a license to use full desktop version of Microsoft Office so it&rsquo;s a win-win for me since this is an important skill? personally and for work.</p>
<p><strong>Product link: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/CFQ7TTC0K5BF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Office 365 Personal</a></strong></p>
<h2 id="steam">Steam</h2>
<p>Additionally, I don&rsquo;t store my games to where my OS is installed. Steam and most game platforms allows us to locate game files, so I don&rsquo;t have to redownload hundreds of GB game files.</p>
<p><strong>Download link: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></strong></p>
<h2 id="bitwarden">Bitwarden</h2>
<p>Ever since I experienced being hacked, I immediately started using a password manager/generator to make my passwords not the same - YES what a shame.</p>
<p><strong>Download link: <a href="https://bitwarden.com/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitwarden</a></strong></p>
<h2 id="winrar">WinRAR</h2>
<p>Compress and extract files and folders with unlimited 40 day trial.</p>
<p><strong>Download link: <a href="https://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&amp;L=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WinRAR</a></strong></p>
<h2 id="spotify">Spotify</h2>
<p>Even though the lack of lossless audio format, Spotify is my go-to music service. Unless it came preinstalled with Windows.</p>
<p><strong>Download links: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NCBCSZSJRSB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify (Microsoft Store)</a> | <a href="https://www.spotify.com/kw-en/download/windows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify (.exe setup)</a></strong></p>
<h2 id="voicemeeter-banana">VoiceMeeter Banana</h2>
<p>One of the most useful audio mixer I use. I allows to mix and manage audio inputs and outputs to use for other communication apps.</p>
<p><strong>Download link: <a href="https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VoiceMeeter Banana</a></strong></p>
<h2 id="visual-studio-code">Visual Studio Code</h2>
<p>I use this as code editor for Flutter/Dart mobile development and other source codes like this blog.</p>
<p><strong>Download link: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio Code</a></strong></p>
<h2 id="visual-studio">Visual Studio</h2>
<p>The full IDE software for various development cases. I mainly use it for Windows app development as I haven&rsquo;t got into webapps as of now. I code and create apps using WinForms, WPF, and UWP (WinUI). I also tried Xamarin.Forms but I moved onto Flutter for cross-platform mobile app development.</p>
<p><strong>Download link: <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio</a></strong></p>
<h2 id="obs-studio">OBS Studio</h2>
<p>I used this for streaming, recording and virtual camera purposes. I now use OBS instead of XSplit. The software is FREE and much lightweight. It also has features and other free plugins made by the community.</p>
<p><strong>Download link: <a href="https://obsproject.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OBS Studio</a></strong></p>
<h2 id="figma">Figma</h2>
<p>This free app is browser-based but can also be downloaded as a desktop app. It was made for designers to build UI/UX interfaces - which I sometimes do when making apps. I also use this to make a quick and simple logos and other graphics.</p>
<p><strong>Download link: <a href="https://www.figma.com/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Figma Desktop</a></strong></p>
<p> 
 
 </p>
<p>Now on to mobile apps. I switched to iPhone nearly a year ago because of the hardware-and-software stability (in my opinion) and the support does not end after 2 or 3 years, unlike Android. So resetting my device (after a really really bad beta software) isn&rsquo;t that much of a hassle because of iCloud backups.</p>
<h1 id="mobile-apps">Mobile Apps</h1>
<p>Here are my top apps that I use on a daily basis. I will not put the specific store page instead I will link to their website for mobile downloads (if available). I&rsquo;ll list the apps I use on both platforms (PC and Mobile)</p>
<h2 id="spotify-1">Spotify</h2>
<h2 id="bitwarden-1">Bitwarden</h2>
<h3 id="steam-mobile">Steam Mobile</h3>
<h2 id="microsoft-office-outlook-and-onedrive">Microsoft Office, Outlook, and OneDrive</h2>
<p>I put them together here since they are not in a suite but the new Office app user-wise deprecated the standalone Word, Excel, and PowerPoint apps since you can view and edit your documents in one app.</p>
<p><strong>Download links: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/microsoft-365/mobile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Office Mobile App</a> | <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/outlook-mobile-for-android-and-ios" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Outlook Mobile</a> | <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OneDrive Mobile App</a></strong></p>
<h2 id="twitter">Twitter</h2>
<p>Where I get updated to what&rsquo;s happening. I only follow niche and some well-known &ldquo;wholesome and awesome&rdquo; Twitter users.</p>
<p><strong>Download link: <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/download?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a></strong></p>
<h2 id="facebook-messenger">Facebook Messenger</h2>
<p>Yup, most family members and friends are into messenger chats so that&rsquo;s no escaping Facebook.</p>
<h2 id="gcash">GCash</h2>
<p>Globe Telecom&rsquo;s virtual wallet now available for all networks.</p>
<h2 id="youtube-and-reddit">YouTube and Reddit</h2>
<p>My other ways to consume content.</p>
<h2 id="microsoft-edge">Microsoft Edge</h2>
<p>Despite the sync being subpar to Google Chrome, I prefer this one as my main browser on my iPhone.</p>
<p><strong>Download link: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge#platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Edge Web Browser</a></strong></p>
<h2 id="shopee">Shopee</h2>
<p>Every once in a while (trust me 🤣) we just want to shop online. I recently deleted my Lazada account because it annoyed me so much with their shenanigans - which I am not really sure.</p>
<p><strong>Download link: <a href="https://shp.ee/x6uyiut" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopee PH</a></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>So far these are my <em>top</em> apps that I use on my mobile phone. Let me know what&rsquo;s your most used apps!</p>

<p>I only play the game against custom BOT scripts 🤣 just to past time or just to be updated with what patches <a href="https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/IceFrog" target="_blank">IceFrog</a> brings to the game. What I mostly do is watch major tournaments especially those when teams need to earn <a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Dota_Pro_Circuit" target="_blank">DPC points</a> for entering the prestigious TI.</p>
<h2 id="10-days-of-dota">10 Days of DOTA</h2>
<p>#TI10 started on October 7th with 18 qualified teams playing playoffs on the group stage to determine their position either on the upper or lower bracket; and where two teams: Thunder Predator and SG, in the end, bid farewell for the Main Stage and championship.</p>

<p>Now, as of this writing, we just ended Day 3 of the Main Stage and I&rsquo;ve followed and watched most of the games. Fnatic, a SEA team with 2 Pinoy players, got eliminated on Day 2 just after getting past a heart-wrenching Best-of-One&rsquo;s on the Lower Bracket the day before. The last SEA representative, T1, would have to give their best on their lower bracket run.</p>

<p>Watching all games and supporting SEA teams, my heart still goes to Team Secret for all their TI runs. Right now, they already secured Top 3 finish for the semifinals game against PSG.LGD.</p>

<p>I follow the games by watching <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/singsing" target="_blank">singsing&rsquo;s Twitch stream</a> as he and his (pepega) friends cast and analyze the stream - chill and fun. This way I can watch (or listen) while doing app coding.</p>
<h2 id="coding-and-appdates">Coding and Appdates</h2>
<p>This 10-day tournament meant a break from me streaming (to catch the games) which then allowed me time to code for RPN News mobile app.</p>
<p>My job (finally) provided me a Samsung A71 Android phone to test the app (and for work-related stuff) after my old personal phone went bust; though I still use my iPhone 11 to test the iOS code - maybe soon? 🤣</p>
<figure><figcaption>
            <p>Samsung A71</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The app has been up on the Google Play Store for some time (as I blogged <a href="https://reddavid.me/rpn-android-app/" target="_blank">here</a>) and lacked significant updates. It stayed that way for a while until all busy-ness and code-confusion (is this even a term?) has subsided.</p>
<p>These past days, I managed to release an update for the Android beta app and also started a TestFlight for iOS devices.</p>
<p>I decided to version the app as 2.0 as this was a complete rework from the old code despite not publicly releasing a version 1.0. The app was previously coded on C#/Xamarin Forms but the documentation and support I needed was &ldquo;not there&rdquo;, then I started to code on Dart/Flutter for RPN Radio which made things easier - being a single-codebase mobile app development.</p>
<p>Version 2.0 brings a new UI and supports offline mode - see downloaded news (as opposed to before that it will not work when there is no internet; though it is always recommended to be connected to get the latest news).</p>

    <title>RPN Radio UI Overhaul</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/rpnradio-ui-overhaul/</link>
    <pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 00:15:36 &#43;0800</pubDate><dc:creator>David</dc:creator><guid>https://reddavid.me/rpnradio-ui-overhaul/</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/feat/rpnradio-ui.jpeg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>Browsing Instagram on my account now floods me with several UI/UX tips and practices, making me inspired to update and retouch my apps with some latest trends in mobile designs.</p>
<h1 id="old-look">Old Look</h1>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at what the app looked like before the update:</p>
<figure class="image">


<figcaption><em>Old UI</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>Though it looked intuitive - with just two simple steps: 1) Launch app, 2) Select station and Listen; the main page does not give the user context on what the app does, which raise this question:</p>
<p><strong><em>What am I supposed to do?</em></strong></p>
<h2 id="menu-list">Menu List</h2>
<p>At first glance of a first-time user, the stations list does NOT show that it is &ldquo;clickable&rdquo;. So the first UI update was to change the 4x3 grid to a simple list.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Station Menu Item Before and After</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>This subtle change provides the user a hint of &ldquo;click me&rdquo; by giving the list item a design of a button. It also gave a space for the station&rsquo;s detail to be added - station&rsquo;s location and live/offline status.</p>
<h2 id="header-and-controls">Header and Controls</h2>
<p>Ok, this area will look crammed especially on small-screen devices. Before this update though, I repositioned the buttons below the controls and were still crammed. This update allowed the horizontal list to be scrolled.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Header & Controls Before and After</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>I also changed the text that shows the current stations into a simpler one and updated the share icon.</p>
<h2 id="new-font">New Font</h2>
<p>I like <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Poppins</a>.
<br></p>
<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>Besides the UI updates mentioned above, I added an &ldquo;About&rdquo; page. It is a simple about and external links of RPN.</p>

            </div><p>Now that ZIP Code PH is available for both Android and iOS, I wanted to build a landing page for it.</p>
<h1 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h1>
<p>I viewed some designs online and found inspiration from <a href="https://get-thrive.app/" target="_blank">Thrive</a>, which I never heard of - thanks anyway!</p>
<h1 id="launch-and-land">Launch and Land</h1>
<p>The webpage is available <a href="https://reddavid.me/zipcodeph-app" target="_blank">HERE</a>. The page is still a link to my website but will soon acquire a domain for it soon. Also, the page is still a basic design but complete with the download links, which I will improve soon.</p>
<p>Will keep you updated!</p>

    <title>Tune In RPN Radio Update</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/tunein-update/</link>
    <pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2021 20:30:09 &#43;0800</pubDate><dc:creator>David</dc:creator><guid>https://reddavid.me/tunein-update/</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/feat/rpn-tunein.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>I updated the tune-in website for RPN. This post will detail the changes, what&rsquo;s new or removed, and how the update went.</p>
<h1 id="mainpage-and-mobile-first-design">MainPage and Mobile-First Design</h1>
<p>The main page remains got a few changes, starting with the font face and size. Before the update, the font family forced to check for <a href="https://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/proxima-nova" target="_blank">Proxima Nova</a> and fallback to Arial Nova or other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif" target="_blank">sans serif fonts.</a></p>
<p>Then I cleaned up my CSS file to make the whole website <a href="https://medium.com/@Vincentxia77/what-is-mobile-first-design-why-its-important-how-to-make-it-7d3cf2e29d00" target="_blank">&ldquo;mobile-first&rdquo;.</a>
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="now-playing-station-pages">Now Playing Station Pages</h1>
<p>The tune-in or now playing page received most of the update. I&rsquo;ve broken some of them below:</p>
<h2 id="back-button">Back Button</h2>
<p>The back button got a lot of love with some logic. At first, the button always takes you to the home (main) page with the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag attribute <code>href=&quot;/&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s got a javascript code that checks for an open navigation menu, and whether the history came from the tunein.rpnradio.com domain.</p>
<pre><code>function goBack() {
  if (isNavOpen) {
    closeNav();
  }
  else if (document.referrer == "") {
    window.location.href = "https://tunein.rpnradio.com/";
  }
  else {
    window.history.back();
  }
}; </code></pre>
<p>This logic was finalized when I opened a page link on my iPhone then the back button took me to the previous page - other site.</p>
<p>Now the back button takes you to home page when started with a station page.</p>
<h2 id="navigation-menu">Navigation Menu</h2>
<p>The station pages got a navigation menu that resembles the home page. This is to give the listener a continuous audio stream playback whilst needing to change a station.</p>
<p>Note: The navigation drawer will not work on browser back button - as I learned with other sites. The browser just simply go back to the previous page.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="security">Security</h1>
<p>The website was also SSL-enabled - <a href="https://www.websecurity.digicert.com/security-topics/https-everywhere" target="_blank">HTTPS Everywhere.</a></p>
<p>This also means that the old stream URLs will not work. Thankfully, the audio servers have secured stream URLs for secure websites.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="open-graph-metadata">Open Graph Metadata</h1>
<p>Social Media sites are the places where websites get the most referrers. So having metadata for them not just makes the website Facebook- or Twitter-friendly but it is a great addition to how it would look like when shared.</p>
<p>Making the images took waaaaay longer than I expected. I decided to add 3 mockup devices that shows the website on these devices. You can see the share preview below:</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Facebook Open Graph Preview</em></figcaption>
<br/>

<figcaption><em>Twitter Open Graph Preview</em></figcaption>
</figure>
Creating the metadata tags was made easy by using <a href="https://metatags.io/" target="_blank">Metatags.io</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
<h1 id="site-icons">Site Icons</h1>
<p>I went on to also update the website&rsquo;s favicons, to differentiate tunein to the news website. It now has the Android app icon below:</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><em>Website Favicon</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<h1 id="google-ads">Google Ads</h1>
<p>I replaced the part suggesting other methods to tunein (Zeno app, Radio Garden and our native Android app) with a Google Auto ad.</p>
<p>We all hate ads but this is the only modest way to profit for most websites.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="htaccess-to-remove-html">.htaccess to Remove .html</h1>
<p>I finally made it to work, shorten the address for site navigation. Instead of showing the full file name: <pre><small>tunein.rpnradio.com/batac.html</small></pre>
Some rules were added to the .htaccess file to make it <pre><small>tunein.rpnradio.com/batac</small></pre></p>
<p>.htaccess file:</p>
<pre><code>RewriteEngine On 
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off 
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]

RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} /([^.]+)\.html [NC]
RewriteRule ^ /%1 [NC,L,R]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}.html -f
RewriteRule ^ %{REQUEST_URI}.html [NC,L]
</code></pre>
<br/>
<h1 id="footer-finally">Footer Finally</h1>
<p>I added a subtle footer to the whole website. That&rsquo;s it. :)
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="final-words">Final Words</h1>
<p>This website is another medium for the company&rsquo;s aim for a greater reach by expanding to Digital Media. In addition to our native apps (which is available for Android - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rpnradio.radiov1&hl=en&gl=US" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a> and <a href="https://appgallery.huawei.com/#/app/C103076031" target="_blank">Huawei App Gallery</a>), the website also serves a means for our audiences to access our stations' broadcast anytime and anywhere in the world.</p>

    <title>Developing for Apple Soon</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/developing-for-apple-soon/</link>
    <pubDate>Sat, 06 Feb 2021 00:40:14 &#43;0800</pubDate><dc:creator>David</dc:creator><guid>https://reddavid.me/developing-for-apple-soon/</guid>

            </div><h1 id="apple-user---me">Apple User -&gt; Me</h1>
<p>Yes, I gave in to use an Apple device. Well, I&rsquo;ve tried an iPhone XS before, and I must admit, having a device with software dedicated to its hardware is chef&rsquo;s kiss. That&rsquo;s what I liked about Apple, the hardware and software work along each other, and like most people, the price-tag for their phones held me back until December.</p>
<p>I <em>loaned</em> for an iPhone 11 since the iPhone 12 is expensive and I like the 11&rsquo;s grip instead of the sharp edges of the new design. I got a yellow one since the black sold out. Then I realized black, though very simple, is such a generic color that it doesn&rsquo;t stand out as a phone&rsquo;s color and I&rsquo;ve had too many black phones before.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Yellow iPhone 11</em></figcaption>

<br/>
<h1 id="developing-for-ios-soon">Developing for iOS soon</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to learn new things and finally applying the cross-platform capabilities of <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin/xamarin-forms">Xamarin.Forms</a> which I have used in some of my Android apps and it&rsquo;s <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/">C#</a>. I also want to check out native code from Apple, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a>.</p>
<p>Developing for Apple is quite costly, that you need to own a Mac (or rent online) and ₱4450 ($99) for an individual to publish to the App Store. And it is YEARLY.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>iOS 14 App Library (is that TikTok? 😅)</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>So, to test things out, I would be putting my app <a href="/zipcodeph-android-dark-mode/">ZIP Code PH</a> on the App Store and might set a (very very small) price to support this costly Apple environment 😂.</p>
<h1 id="for-the-meantime">For the meantime&hellip;</h1>
<p>Go ahead and check out my apps on the <a href="ms-windows-store:publisher?name=Red David">Windows 10 Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=5465762079490576029">Google Play Store</a> both under Red David.</p>
<p>See you soon!</p>

    <title>ZIP Code PH for Android gets Dark Mode</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/zipcodeph-android-dark-mode/</link>
    <pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2021 23:17:22 &#43;0800</pubDate><dc:creator>David</dc:creator><guid>https://reddavid.me/zipcodeph-android-dark-mode/</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div><h1 id="the-pandemic-and-night-owls">The Pandemic and Night Owls</h1>
<p>My app, ZIP Code PH, has been available on Google Play Store for more than a year now and because of the pandemic, more and more people are staying at home and are mostly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_owl_(person)">night-owls</a>.</p>
<p>And app and software developers are now giving their projects dark mode - not just to follow accessibility standards but offer an option for people to reduce or avoid eye strain.</p>
<h1 id="heres-dark-mode-for-ya">Here&rsquo;s Dark Mode for ya</h1>
<p>So here I am, picking up again on coding (for my apps) and started giving some apps a dark flavor. It almost took me a month to develop and test since available Xamarin Forms documentation didn&rsquo;t suit my liking.</p>
<h1 id="quick-app-features">Quick App Features</h1>
<ul>
<li>Toggle light and dark mode</li>
<li>Quick search Philippine ZIP codes</li>
<li>Favorite (Bookmark) selected ZIP codes for easy reference</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="screenshots">Screenshots</h1>
<p>See for yourself the light and dark mode for the app below.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>ZIP Code PH - List</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>I chose <code>#222222</code> as the background color for darkmode so it is easier in the eyes (at least for me and some design posts I read somewhere). If someone requests an option for a darker color, I&rsquo;d be glad to add it. (Themes, maybe? 🤔)</p>
<h1 id="make-me-happy">Make me happy</h1>
<p>Yes, please. Make me happy by downloading the app, write a review and give a rating of 5 stars. The app is available for Android, on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.reddvid.zipcodeph">Google Play Store</a> and <a href="https://appgallery.huawei.com/#/app/C103245343">Huawei App Gallery.</a></p>
<p>It is free to download, I hope you welcome ads that earns a me a little. Thank you and until next app!</p>

    <title>RPN Radio: Streaming App for Android</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/rpnradio-android/</link>
    <pubDate>Wed, 03 Feb 2021 01:25:58 &#43;0800</pubDate><dc:creator>David</dc:creator><guid>https://reddavid.me/rpnradio-android/</guid>

            </div><p>This should just be a short post to promote and showcase this Android app I developed for my job.</p>
<h1 id="am-radio-in-your-pocket">AM Radio in your Pocket</h1>
<p>Choose from RPN&rsquo;s <a href="https://rpnradio.com/" target="_blank">(Radio Philippines Network)</a> 12 regional AM stations to tune into. Just connect to the internet and be updated to the latest news, talks, and enjoy some old and new tunes.</p>
<h1 id="development">Development</h1>
<p>I tried making this app using Xamarin.Forms but the new Android implementation of the media notification sucked a** that I made the app in pure <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide">Android Java code</a>.</p>
<h1 id="app-description">App Description</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>RPN&rsquo;s 12 radio stations are situated among the three major parts of the Philippines - in Luzon, we have DZRL Batac and DZBS Baguio that will give you the latest news, updates, music and other events happening in the North in Ilocano; and DZKI Iriga to offer them in Rinkonada Bikol and/or Bikolano. Next in Visayas, DYKC Cebu and DYKB Bacolod operates in the heart of Cebu City and neighboring Bacolod City, respectively. DYKC Cebu provides an programming format that will surely make all Cebuanos and Bisaya all around the world miss home. While DYKB Bacolod gives you the most important news and talkshows in Hiligaynon and/or Ilonggo. Lastly, Mindanao holds most of our stations : DXKS Surigao, DXKO Cagayan de Oro, DXDX General Santos, DXKP Pagadian, DXXX Zamboanga, and DXKT Davao.</p>
