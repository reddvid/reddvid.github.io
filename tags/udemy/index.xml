        <description>&lt;img src="https://reddavid.me/images/og/new-post.png" alt="Featured image of post I Am Here" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, how about that? I think I just had the longest time without posting anything here. Maybe I just posted thrice within February just to escape the next ones. 🥲&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so what alibis do I have to tell you this time? Hmm 🤔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-learned-a-new-thing-about-computer-hardware&#34;&gt;I Learned a New Thing about Computer Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have this &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://reddavid.me/fix-nvidia-game-crashing-black-screen-on-windows-11-nvlddmkm-error/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about my Nvidia GPU issue on games crashing and black screens and &lt;em&gt;somehow&lt;/em&gt; fixing it? It might have been because my motherboard is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; compatible with my RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, PC hardware in 2022-2023 is not at all just buy the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; parts you can afford and just build as I assumed it to be. My last PC build I did was waaaaay back 2012-ish, no fancy RGBs, heavy metal cases, no flashy cable-management, and they somehow work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;tenor-gif-embed&#34; data-postid=&#34;7555951312549958006&#34; data-share-method=&#34;host&#34; data-aspect-ratio=&#34;1.33333&#34; data-width=&#34;100%&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tenor.com/view/tv-family-guy-pepperidge-farm-remember-gif-7555951312549958006&#34;&gt;Tv Family Guy GIF&lt;/a&gt;from &lt;a href=&#34;https://tenor.com/search/tv-gifs&#34;&gt;Tv GIFs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;script type=&#34;text/javascript&#34; async src=&#34;https://tenor.com/embed.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;workaround&lt;/em&gt; worked for a while until I felt the need to play newer games, especially the day-one releases on my &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Xbox Game Pass for PC&lt;/a&gt; subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-jumped-shipped-to-amd&#34;&gt;I jumped shipped to AMD&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a month of checking out some GPUs (which I can afford) to replace the current one, it only seemed that I can only get an AMD card. I chose to end with an ASUS 6700XT which seems powerful enough for the games&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has 12GB of VRAM which I am yet to &lt;em&gt;fully&lt;/em&gt; utilize. More detailed specs can be seen from the product page &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/dual/dual-rx6700xt-12g/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got into trouble installing the card as it is actually huge and no margin for the tower case I have, but managed to fit it - very very fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the issues I had months prior to upgrading? Well, it was much worse, and I once again assumed that “AMD still has some driver issues these days, huh?”, since driver &lt;em&gt;workaround&lt;/em&gt; does not seem to fix whatever is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides games crashing, I also began getting random black screens, and even total PC shutdown. I also thought of losing the “silicon lottery” or even my PSU is not enough for the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not until I &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; bothered myself checking my motherboard’s support website for Memory Compatibility. And guess what, I did find my RAMs’ brand and model from the list but what was NOT compatible was putting four sticks in - which I recently did to get 32gigs of memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;going-64gb-for-games&#34;&gt;Going 64GB for Games?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spent weeks not gaming just to avoid the issues until I found some RAM deals online that I got myself 64GB of, ehem, &lt;em&gt;compatible&lt;/em&gt; memory sticks for my motherboard. Well, I hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my order arrived, I spent no time installing the new RAM sticks and fingers-crossed on launching a game where I definitely faced a crash. Tested on more games to finally tell that there were no more problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played High on Life and Atomic Heart just to name a few. And they are on my YouTube gaming channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went over to get 64GB not just for games but for &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enable-virtualization-on-windows-11-pcs-c5578302-6e43-4b4b-a449-8ced115f58e1&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;hardware virtualization&lt;/a&gt; like Virtual Machines, Android emulators, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;good-rest&#34;&gt;Good Rest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I and the wife also took some time off work to unwind somewhere south. We went to a private resort and go for night swim, eat good food, and relaxed a bit with a super mediocre massage (which is, OMG, I wish to erase this memory on just being a crappy service 😂).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;fish-and-veggies-laong-laan.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Dinner at Laong Laan Restaurant&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dinner at Laong Laan Restaurant&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a month, we visited Batangas for a day to celebrate Barangay &lt;em&gt;fiesta&lt;/em&gt; with the family, which means cheat day (in food, of course). We got to watch a very late night but fun Gay pageant. (Sorry, I can&amp;rsquo;t upload some pictures or videos because &amp;ldquo;lewd&amp;rdquo; 😂)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just days later, I got to visit Intramuros, finally, together with the wife, my sister, and my mother. I always wanted to visit the place and never got to do it for a very long time. We got to see the “Walled City”, go inside Manila Cathedral, and visit Fort Santiago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;inside-fort-santiago.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Inside Fort Santiago, Manila&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Inside Fort Santiago, Manila&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After walking around Intramuros, we went ahead to Luneta Park to chill back until sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;neth-in-rizal-park.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Me wife in Rizal Park&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Me wife in Rizal Park&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;keep-learning&#34;&gt;Keep Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently bought &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/c/EposVox&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;EposVox&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://eposvox.gumroad.com/l/obs-definitive-guide-2023-eposvox&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;OBS Masterclass&lt;/a&gt; which might help me learn more about the capabilities of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://obsproject.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;OBS Studio&lt;/a&gt;, in streaming and recording, and other video stuff. I haven’t finished it all yet since I found it hard to track the course in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gumroad.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Gumroad&lt;/a&gt; so I coded a simple website that has a jumplist to the chapters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;custom-website.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Custom website for EposVox masterclass videos&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Custom website for EposVox masterclass videos&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also completed courses in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.udemy.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Udemy&lt;/a&gt; in IT Management where I learned some insightful tips if I ever go further in this IT journey and career. Also found some $1 video courses on HumbleBundle about Cybersecurity, which I plan to watch and learn from soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple more sources and materials I tend to read and watch from time-to-time for me to not &lt;em&gt;waste time&lt;/em&gt; of just consuming content but actually learning. Which point to lesser time on…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;games&#34;&gt;Games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After upgrading my GPU, I actually finished playing Atomic Heart and found myself tired so I went to playing shorter games as I browse Xbox Game Pass. I played short games (~3 or ~4 hours) which I enjoyed playing on &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; time. Also played a bit online with my friend overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one night, while drunk (and while Steam Summer Sale is on-going), I purchased &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/a&gt; knowing that it is a VR game and I HAVE NO VR headset (sorry for the caps). I just thought of adding it to my “backlog” of games until I have a VR kit, but checking the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/bfeber/HLA-NoVR&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;HLA-NoVR mod on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, I gave it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That same night, I downloaded both HL:A and the mod, ran it and WOW. It…kinda…works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know the game on mouse and keyboard is not as immersive as &lt;em&gt;in-your-face&lt;/em&gt; VR but WOW, I am playing a new Half-Life game after how many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I faced a few bugs and missed out on some things and &lt;em&gt;innovations&lt;/em&gt; I saw circulating online back then but overall I am amazed how they actually did it. The full playthrough is on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLwC47NQhSu5xDoW5kwv0Pc5-x71Dvmj2Y&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;coding&#34;&gt;Coding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the lack of energy to play games, I spent more time on coding being inspired by new modern design by Microsoft for Windows apps. Which I recently updated two of my apps I use mostly to help we “work”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both apps got some code improvements and their UI were updated from &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/Kinnara/ModernWpf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ModernWPF&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://wpfui.lepo.co/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;WPF-UI&lt;/a&gt;. The latter lacks most controls but overshadowed by the use of the Mica effect for my WPF apps but I got the most out of it. Hopefully the package gets updated with more controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a GIF of the changes the apps went:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;digiman-update.gif&#34;
         alt=&#34;Digital Manager UI changes&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Digital Manager UI changes&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;id-maker-update.gif&#34;
         alt=&#34;ID Maker UI changes&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ID Maker UI changes&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also updated both to .NET Core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading this life update blog post, I wonder if I could make this blog more “news-like” or devlog? I could promise but thank you again for coming!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Look Back on 2022</title>
        <link>https://reddavid.me/a-look-back-on-2022/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2022 20:03:45 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://reddavid.me/a-look-back-on-2022/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://reddavid.me/images/og/look-back.png" alt="Featured image of post A Look Back on 2022" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we are, the last day of 2022, still felt weird with what happened with the world and to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started the year with a fresh start by taking a vacation (as usual) to celebrate the previous year ending in the province. But something really bad, I caught - Covid. Yes, I knew it was it when I felt it because my body went from 💯 to kaput in a couple of hours. I detailed most of it here &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://reddavid.me/new-in-2022/#i-got-the-bad-v&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;in this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That took me three weeks to rest up because of “weird” instructions before I went back to work again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also a good thing since I picked up playing &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Hollow Knight&lt;/a&gt; during my isolation and quarantine weeks - and it was really good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished through the game at 112% in the coming weeks (or months? thanks Godhome!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also resumed coding - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://reddavid.me/updating-rpnradio-mobile-app/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;updating some apps&lt;/a&gt; and personal projects here and there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;github-contributions-graph.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;GitHub contributions graph&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;GitHub contributions graph&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got myself an &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck-mk2&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Elgato Stream Deck MK.2&lt;/a&gt; (which I detailed &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://reddavid.me/elgato-streamdeck/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) to ease some workflows and which I mostly learned about &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.figma.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Figma&lt;/a&gt;’s Auto layout feature to manage &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/reddvid/mnml-strmdck-icns&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;my own custom icons for the Stream Deck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see my &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/reddvid/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; contributions graph above, I barely did anything past April since I went and did some online course/s and read some books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Philippines, April/May is summertime and finally we had an “outing” - more details on this post &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://reddavid.me/life-updates/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. We also got to celebrate my mom&amp;rsquo;s 50th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last linked post above was my last one to prepare for our wedding on October. I didn’t think much of how it went well but it was a long time coming after 8 years being together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to Roheim in San Fabian, Pangasinan for our honeymoon and the place was empty (besides the workers). I don’t know if we were lucky to spend time alone but it was worthwhile. We actually vlogged the place below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kBeX_ON3Pf4&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;November was still kinda busy setting up our own place we can call home, opening gifts, moving some things, and actually buying furniture and whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got myself a PC (finally!) before the year ends. I ended up sourcing the parts at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://pcx.com.ph/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;PC Express&lt;/a&gt; after comparing to 5 stores. I also built it myself - took 3.5 hours and sadly no vlog or documentation - which I intend to change in 2023 (gotta love myself more!). &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://reddavid.me/gaming#pc-specs&#34; &gt;See PC Specs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>And... it&#39;s December</title>
        <link>https://reddavid.me/and...-its-december/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2022 01:21:59 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://reddavid.me/and...-its-december/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;How many times have I apologized for not posting on my blog? 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s just recap, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-got-married&#34;&gt;I Got Married&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, people still marry despite the hardships in this f-ing country, and I am one of them last October. We both felt it is time after 8 years of being together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prior months were not all wedding-preparations as I read and took some online courses and learning programs - more about &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://flutter.dev/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Flutter&lt;/a&gt;, and leadership/project management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;learning-in-depth-flutter&#34;&gt;Learning In-Depth Flutter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infamous Angela Yu’s Flutter bootcamp course on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.udemy.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Udemy&lt;/a&gt; has been sitting on my learning for a few months and I finally decided to take it on since I really really have to update and improve my Flutter/Dart coding - and to update some apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I faced some problems with the course since it was outdated to the current Flutter version but it all went good, thanks for the updated documentation of Flutter and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://pub.dev&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;pub.dev&lt;/a&gt; packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned DRY (&lt;strong&gt;d&lt;/strong&gt;on’t &lt;strong&gt;r&lt;/strong&gt;epeat &lt;strong&gt;y&lt;/strong&gt;ourself) - again - especially with Flutter’s all code UI. So, learning to convert most reusable Widgets to “components” is fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned a few techniques and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;updating-rpn-radio-app&#34;&gt;Updating RPN Radio App&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my “wedding” break from the office, I came back with the motivation to update this app. Before updating, there was a “downgrade” with the app logic which disabled viewing stations’ &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;offline&lt;/em&gt; status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the app needed a UI/UX refresh - well at least for the player part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://reddavid.me/images/12-22/rpnradio.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;RPN Radio App UI before and after&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;RPN Radio App UI before and after (Note: After image was taken when stations were offline)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app is now available to download for free on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rpnradio.radiov1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=US&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rpn-radio/id1571699396&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Apple App Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;next&#34;&gt;Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also tested Flutter’s web app by building a working web version of my simple app, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://reddavid.me/zipcodeph-app/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ZIP Code PH&lt;/a&gt;. It’s really really simple as of this moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be also going in-depth with Firebase and Firebase Auth to improve the mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gaming-and-streaming&#34;&gt;Gaming and Streaming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, after coming back from the break, I felt no energy to play games - continue playing Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey or any other games on my Xbox PC game pass. And whenever I start a new game, I feel bored can’t motivate myself to continue playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to play Dead Space, Battlefield 4, and VALORANT this November but also felt nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is this game called 7 Days to Die on Steam that I am currently playing (not regularly, though) and I’ll see if it’s worth playing through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catch me on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/RedDavidGG&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

        <title>Finishing this MS Office Course on Udemy. (Or Am I?)</title>
        <link>https://reddavid.me/finishing-msoffice-udemy-course/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2022 02:21:21 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://reddavid.me/finishing-msoffice-udemy-course/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://reddavid.me/finishing-msoffice-udemy-course/udemy-og.png" alt="Featured image of post Finishing this MS Office Course on Udemy. (Or Am I?)" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.udemy.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Udemy&lt;/a&gt; is a website catering online courses for everyone who wants to learn something new, continue learning, and to expand the current knowledge of a particular topic. And this time I wanted to advance my knowledge with Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Udemy offers vast courses by frequently promoting sales. I actually got this complete course way back 2020 and I have been on and off the course by selecting the lecture topics to focus on. And also when I got other current shorter courses more appropriate on that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;advancing-my-ms-office-knowledge&#34;&gt;Advancing my MS Office Knowledge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course is entitled, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-office-excel-word-access-powerpoint/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Ultimate Microsoft Office; Excel, Word, PowerPoint &amp;amp; Access&lt;/a&gt; - though they added and updated it to include the 2019 and 365 updates and other Office products. I got it for around 700PHP, and I was overwhelmed with how many lectures were there for all Office products:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Word&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PowerPoint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outlook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OneNote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, there are 625 lectures with the videos totaling 68.5 hours. The topics start with an Office program explaining from the basics into advanced. And as stated on the course page, this is What I Will Learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn the essential and advanced Microsoft Office&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skills in Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams and Access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn practical methods to backup and recover your&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excel spreadsheets and never lose data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discover the essentials of using formulas and functions in Excel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn practical methods to sort and filter your data in Excel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how to insert shapes, graphics and pictures to add some &amp;ldquo;zing&amp;rdquo; to your PowerPoint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wow your audience by adding animations, audio and video to PowerPoint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn time saving techniques including how to copy slides, and exporting your presentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn Word tools including using columns, indents, footers, borders and watermarks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how to correctly Print envelopes and labels in Word&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert professional pictures and graphics in your Word document&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sorting information and running queries in Access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discover how to into import data from Excel in Access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to compact, repair and backup your Access database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to get set up in Outlook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to customize your mailbox and view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to organize and manage your mail including ignoring, flagging and conditional formatting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use signatures and voting buttons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with the Outlook Calendar, including creating meetings and appointments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and more!!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with Word even though it&amp;rsquo;s the most app I used and most familiar with. Then Outlook, OneNote, Excel, Teams, and now currently into PowerPoint. I actually watched the basics videos with 1.5x-1.75x speed since I already have a good understanding with it since I have been using a computer back 2006-ish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, can I finish it this April? Or do I still have to stop for the MS Access lectures (does anyone ever use Access)?&lt;/p&gt;
