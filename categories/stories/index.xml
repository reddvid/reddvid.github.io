            </div><p>Well how about that?! I just said about how I am prone to procrastinating on my last blog post (over 2 months ago!) that I wanted to keep pisting at least once a week but guess what, I failed! 🥲</p>
<p>Though it&rsquo;s not laziness, I just didn&rsquo;t have good stories to post since it is still a pandemic over here and I just got back to work after my 2 weeks vacation (ehem, 10 days since I still kept in touch with my responsibilities - online stuff).</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just nothing to share, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But here are some highlights these past 2 months (may or may not be in particular order):</p>
<p><strong>Sleeping earlier</strong>. Visiting the province means that you <strong>MUST</strong> sleep early. Can&rsquo;t do much when waking later in the day.</p>
<p><strong>Cook my own food</strong>. I have been intending to cook a healthy meal long before but time constraints and marketing had been prevented me to do so. But with extra time I got by sleeping and waking up early I get to buy and cook a quick meal.</p>

<p><strong>Read more ebooks</strong>. I can&rsquo;t remember where I found The War of Art (yes, not Art of War). It is a book about fighting resistance of doing art (a metaphor of doing what you REALLY love). It&rsquo;s a short self-development book authored by Steven Pressfield, and later I found that it has sequels or whatever you call it: Do The Work and Turning Pro. Do The Work was originally published first but was updated (I think?) to be the follow-up of TWoA. As the book title says, when overcoming resistance DO THE WORK. Lastly, Turning Pro is about escaping the amateur life (of doing work).</p>
<p>I also stumbled upon a website called <a href="http://mostrecommendedbooks.com" target="blank_">mostrecommendedbooks.com</a>, a website where you can find a list of books which top personalities and celebrities had read. Some notable personalities I leisurely checked: Barack Obama, Bill Gates, Elon Musk (this man is futuristic and really into tech!), Dwayne &ldquo;The Rock&rdquo; Johnson, PewDiePie, Richard Branson, and Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>They all have their niche but I found that they have some mutual titles which I got interested putting into my reading list:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4069.Man_s_Search_for_Meaning" target="blank_">Mindset by Dr. Carol Dweck</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34890015-factfulness" target="blank_">Factfulness by Hans Rosling</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep" target="blank_">Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3228917-outliers" target="blank_">Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell</a></li>

</ul>
<p>I recommend reading <strong>&ldquo;Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning&rdquo;</strong> at least once in your life. 🙂</p>

<p><strong>Online Courses</strong>. These are some online video courses like Udemy. I am currently half-way through Microsoft Office 2019 course. I still have Flutter/Dart development, Web development, and UI with Figma development courses on <a href="https://udemy.com/" target="blank_">Udemy</a> and some on other sites.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The beautiful thing about learning is nobody can take it away from you.&rdquo; - B.B. King</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>These are the amazing things happened for the past months except the first two didn&rsquo;t last since my girlfriend recently got a graveyard shift work where we can only talk at around 2:30am (GMT+8) during her (lunch) break. Don&rsquo;t blame me, I&rsquo;m just a loving person 😂.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about work, it is stressful at times with at least two meetings per week and August was a one hell of ride for the website to migrate and apparently, that was also the month the hosting service will conduct a maintenance. 😬 Despite that, I&rsquo;ve learnt about a few basic things for site security and database optimizations.</p>
<p>There were also a few more layout and quality updates which I will share soon. But you can see what I&rsquo;ve worked on <a href="https://rpnradio.com" target="blank_">rpnradio.com</a> and <a href="https://tunein.rpnradio.com" target="blank_">tunein.rpnradio.com</a>.</p>
<p>As for the company&rsquo;s mobile apps - updates are still pending. I am hoping for a wider schedule to keep my &ldquo;programming momentum&rdquo; uninterrupted because once I started I can&rsquo;t stop until the code works. Trust me, unless I can&rsquo;t figure it out and need a good night&rsquo;s sleep to come up with a fix.</p>
<p>Lastly, on my very very free time, I can get to play and record playing the guitar and upload to my <a href="https://youtube.com/RedDavid" target="blank_">YouTube</a> channel. Feel free to like or dislike. 🤣 I also compensate some time to stream on <a href="https://twitch.tv/reddavidgg" target="blank_">Twitch</a> for a few hours.</p>
<p>I hope these are enough to keep you updated. I will also post some tech buys I did to give myself back for the hard-work I believe I do. Hit me up in <a href="twitter.com/reddvid" target="blank_">Twitter</a> or <a href="facebook.com/reddavidgg" target="blank_">Facebook</a> on how your last two months went!</p>

            </div><p>Okay, hear me out, I am still procrastinating after watching hours TED Talks and YouTube videos on how to be productive and avoid wasting time doing senseless things. What&rsquo;s wrong? Do I have a lot on my mind or in my hands to keep me posting blogs? Can&rsquo;t be motivated by self-help books and videos? Am I still waiting for when &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too late&rdquo;? AARGH</p>
<p></p>

<p>So my last post was June 12, I celebrated my 29th birthday on the 14th and got me self an Elgato HD60S+ to achieve better mobile gaming mirroring but that still, I can&rsquo;t keep my streaming schedule! AARGH (2)</p>
<p>I got the thingy not just to stream games but for future use - like recording &ldquo;How to use this app&rdquo; for YouTube or presentations, so it may be an expensive thing but I always think of them as investment for my app development journey.</p>
<figure><figcaption>

<p>Speaking of streaming, I started streaming on Twitch! Right now, I planned on playing Minecraft, Left 4 Dead 2, and Call of Duty: Mobile. Also, I will try to stream on MWFS schedule playing those games or variety. <a href="https://twitch.tv/RedDavidGG" target="_blank">Give me a follow</a> and get notified when I go live.</p>
<p>I will be using my <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG" target="_blank">Facebook Page</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/rKnJb4J" target="_blank">Discord server</a> to post updates.</p>
<h3 id="stream-setup-mobile-gaming">Stream Setup (Mobile Gaming)</h3>
<p>As of this writing, I am lucky enough to have this setup for mobile game streaming:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://shp.ee/znd3exz" target="_blank">Apple iPhone 11</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Any more happened last week of June? Hmm. Yeah right, I released an update for RPN Radio app for both Android and iOS adding a call-to-action button to send the stations a message thru Facebook Messenger. This was after watching on Udemy that apps or any products always have a goal-in-mind - the stations should increase inquiries for advertisement or any other public service comments.</p>
<p>The app is still available for <strong>FREE</strong> on Google Play Store, Huawei App Store, and iOS App Store. I created this simple app landing page for the <a href="https://tunein.rpnradio.com/download" target="_blank">links.</a></p>

<p>I also got to try the new <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11" target="_blank">Windows 11 Insider Preview</a> on a VM. Tested on my main machine but I can&rsquo;t risk the beta so I rolled back to Windows 10.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start the month with a sweet treat, homemade chocolates courtesy of my SO. Anyone interested? Hit the like on the Instagram post below for us to start selling them. 😊</p>

<p>I got my second dose of Covid vaccine (Sinovac) on the 6th, thankfully there were no side-effects except for the body aches I got after NOT SLEEPING WELL! 🤦‍♂️</p>
<p>With work, I updated the <a href="https://rpnradio.com" target="_blank">RPN website</a> overall layout after migrating to a new hosting provider. And some minor updates to some if not all the online systems.</p>

<h2 id="rainy-vacay">Rainy Vacay</h2>
<p>After that, I decided to take a <del>short</del> long break to escape the <del>jungle</del> NCR Bubble by going home to Pangasinan. I am so longing to be with the family after 6+ months of not going home - I went home last December 2020 to spend the holidays.</p>
<p>I was so looking forward to at least visit a beach, see a sunset, feel the breeze of fresh air but UNLUCKILY the weather ahead was not well! I did not see the predictions that there will be a coming storm for the week. So the first few days were a bust, and I just stayed inside and chilled out with some beer.</p>
<p>The 20th was a holiday, and magically the weather was at least fine for us to go to Binmaley beach - don&rsquo;t worry, there were no crowds so we can be safe, I think? The sun was peeping through the clouds and by the afternoon, a mild rain poured. Together with relatives, we spend some time there swimming, singing, EATING, and drinking booze until it&rsquo;s time to go home.</p>

<p>My other plans went down the drain as the weather became worse, Dagupan City was flooded (plus high tide) that light vehicles weren&rsquo;t able to pass. Sadly, I can&rsquo;t meet my <del>only</del> city friends. There&rsquo;s still next time right? Right?</p>
<p>I decided to extend my stay but continued checking some online responsibilities just to make sure they are still up even I&rsquo;m not present in the office - though I failed to join our online meetings.</p>
<p>We also went to our grandfather&rsquo;s brother to celebrate his 70th birthday. Then we spent some time (and over pizza) with my cousin to talk about tech and stuff.</p>

            </div><p>Huh, who knew? That we can get through the sh*tty year that is 2020. 🤔 And for last time (and maybe first?), let&rsquo;s take a look back to what happened with Red David&rsquo;s life in last year (SPOILER: not so much, like most of us I guess).</p>
<h1 id="january">January</h1>
<h2 id="puerto-galera-2nd-week">Puerto Galera, 2nd week</h2>
<p>New Year, New Decade! We expected a lot in 2020 coming from 2019. It started out pretty much a normal month. We would have the time to travel out of town,</p>
<p>It is always a good feeling when you can travel on the first month of the year, so that&rsquo;s what we did. So my girlfriend and I went to Puerto Galera, Mindoro and rented a place to stay for 3 days and 2 nights.</p>
<p>This place has been a must-travel not just for us both but for most of Pinoys. The white sand beach makes this place present on everybody&rsquo;s bucket list.</p>
<p>Our stay was short but it was worth-while. From walking along the beach, taking &ldquo;artistic&rdquo; photos, watch the sunset enjoyed a quite weekday evening, and chilled during the weekend evening when the &ldquo;bands&rdquo; and music will fill up the place. We also had henna tattoos, got a massage, and just tried to taste all the food.</p>
<p>Here are some of the photos we took during our short stay:</p>

<h2 id="taal-volcano-eruption">Taal Volcano Eruption</h2>
<p>Ok hold on, this wasn&rsquo;t a part of our trip but as we are leaving the port to return to Metro Manila, we found out that Taal Volcano erupted (which was located in Batangas) but thankfully the eruption was slow that we weren&rsquo;t stranded along the way. But this news may be the start of something awful through 2020.</p>
<p>The volcano spewed a lot of volcanic ash that towns and cities, including Metro Manila.</p>
<h2 id="trip-to-bgc-last-week">Trip to BGC, last week</h2>
<p>This should be the last week of January and the KPop group Winner was doing a tour in Manila. I am not a KPop fan but my sister is that the 3 girls in our family went to SM Mall of Asia to watch them.</p>

<p>The next day, we went to visit Baclaran church to give thanks to the Lord and went straight the infamous <a href="https://megaworld-lifestylemalls.com/mall/mckinley-hill/">Venice Grand Canal Mall</a> in Taguig, a Venice-inspired open-air mall.</p>
<figure class="image">

<p>After exhausting the whole place, we went down to Bonifacio High Grounds which is not that far from the canal mall. We just walked around the place, took some photos, and tried to visit a museum but unfortunately they were already closed.</p>
<br/>
<h1 id="february">February</h1>
<h2 id="valentines-day-and-a-new-laptop">Valentine&rsquo;s Day and a New Laptop</h2>
<p>Hmmm, nothing much happened this month, just the usual Valentine&rsquo;s date on the 14th. We just went to this semi-high end restaurant and ordered some pizza, pasta, and wine.</p>
<p>I also got a new laptop, my third Acer laptop - been an Acer user since 2011-ish because of it&rsquo;s ok specs at a lower price. I blogged about that laptop here: <a href="/new-laptop/">I Got Myself a New Laptop</a></p>
<br/>
<h1 id="march">March</h1>
<h2 id="more-like-march-ing-towards-a-global-pandemic">more like MARCH-ing Towards a Global Pandemic</h2>
<p>Oh how it started so well until a <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">new unknown deadly virus broke out of Wuhan, China.</a></p>
<p>It seemed the world has stopped due to lockdowns, and despite the technological advancement we have since the last decade, we still took too long for a cure.</p>
<p>These, I think, are the times we don&rsquo;t want to talk about anymore.</p>
<br/>
<h1 id="april---november">April - November</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ll sumamrize these months here, since we all have been in lock down and stayed in our homes. But luckily for us, our occupation allowed us to still make a living and let us stay in.</p>
<p>Within these months, the government has been extending and extending the quarantine every 30 days - they just fear for public panic if they announce a definite lockdown for a year.</p>
<p>I went busy during these time, did some web and app development, went on to stream some games on <a href="https://facebook.gg/RedDavidGG" target="_blank">Facebook Gaming</a> and took some online courses <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/reddvid/" target="_blank">(view my LinkedIn profile here).</a></p>
<p>With all of these, I upgraded (again) my peripherals for my convenience (sorry Girlfried, 😂). I bought a over-the-head headset and an earbuds, for better Zoom meetings and streaming - the JBL Quantum 200 and the HyperX Cloud earbuds. I also got myself a wireless Logitech gaming mouse, the G304, which I reviewed <a href="/g304-review/">here</a> and a Tecware mechanical keyboard TKL, which you can read more about <a href="/new-keeb/">here.</a></p>

<p>I also went on to upgrade my work PC&rsquo;s SSD for a better brand and higher storage, cheaper though - the XPG 8200. Also bought a JBL Go3 bluetooth speaker, and the Logitech C922 webcam, also for Zoom meetings 🤣. I blogged about the camera here: <a href="/the-logitech-c922/">Finally! Logitech C922</a></p>

<h2 id="christmas-and-new-years-eve">Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s Eve</h2>
<p>This might be the hardest Christmas and New Year we&rsquo;ve all faced and celebrated, but lucky enough, I had the chance to take a break from the rat race and went home to celebrate the holidays with the family together with my father whom was also stuck in his workplace city due to quarantine and lockdown.</p>
<p>The shopping continues, I got myself the Razer Hammerhead Wireless earbuds and a yellow iPhone 11 for Christmas. I did not post a blog about the wireless earbuds since the unit I got was faulty (had it replaced now). And I prefer not to flaunt my new iPhone since there&rsquo;s nothing special about it, my ultimate goal of buying one is to <a href="/developing-for-apple-soon/">develop apps for iOS.</a></p>

<h1 id="hows-your-2020">How&rsquo;s Your 2020?</h1>
<p>This year had been a mix of emotions but mostly depressing. We still coping to the new normal, keeping safe, and I know we all miss socializing.</p>
<p>This might look like a tech shopping spree for me but I also grew my Facebook page from 261 to 940 this year. Played and streamed some good games - MINECRAFT!</p>
<p>Read a few books, got certificates from online courses, and especially I am still alive and healthy.</p>
<p>How did your 2020 go? Tag me on your story.

    <title>Logitech G304 Review</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/g304-review/</link>
    <pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2020 23:42:58 &#43;0800</pubDate>

    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/feat/g304.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>So this is my short and honest review of the G304 wireless mouse.</p>
<p>As I mentioned on my previous blog post <a href="/story-of-owning-logitech-mice/">here</a>, this is my 4th mouse and my first gaming? wireless mouse. I ordered it online from DataBlitz for $39, and was delivered quickly in 2 days.</p>
<br/>
<h1 id="whats-in-the-box">What&rsquo;s in the box?</h1>
<p>The box contains the wireless mouse itself, the usual manuals, Logitech Gaming promo leaflet, a blue G logo sticker, a Duracell AA battery, and a USB extension cord.</p>

<br/>
<h1 id="lets-get-physical">Let&rsquo;s get Physical!</h1>
<p>The mouse has no RGB strip like it&rsquo;s cousins (G Pro/G203) but it has a single RGB LED that indicates colored DPI assignments in Logitech G Hub. The battery compartment and the USB receiver is accessed through the lower top part of the mouse - by sliding it off the body.</p>

<p>I currently use an Energizer Lithium AA battery which I believe is lighter but I still keep the free battery whenever I need a heavier setup.</p>

<p>The power switch is located below the mouse with a red and blue color indicator for off and on state. The bottom also has an extra slide compared to the G Pro/G203.</p>

<p>The mouse shape fits perfectly in my hands and I can switch to the wired G Pro when I play some competitive games - not that this can&rsquo;t do the job. But I often stick to this, G304, every time I stream my games (shameless plug - <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG/">https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG/</a>)</p>
 

<br/>
<h1 id="reliability">Reliability</h1>
<p>I used this since day one - June 2 - and I only got a hiccup once during a Dota 2 game which made me switch to wired, and since then I used this as a daily driver and on my games. Lately, I am playing Minecraft a lot, some Dota 2, CS:GO, some Valorant, Metro Exodus, just finished Mafia II: Definitive Edition, C&amp;C Yuri&rsquo;s Revenge.</p>
<br/>
<h1 id="verdict-at-last">Verdict, at last</h1>
<p>My overall experience using the same shape of a mouse will be just comfortable throughout my day - office job and being a small-time streamer. It also frees your hand positions by not limited by a wired mouse. Despite it not having an RGB, I would suggest this for small-handed people, for those who travel a lot and for gamers and streamers looking for a budget wireless gaming mouse.</p>
<br/>

    <title>Staying at Home During the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/staying-at-home-during-covid19-pandemic/</link>

    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/at-home.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>When the sudden rise of Covid-19 cases here in the Philippines, the government was urged to implement a community quarantine - which was a lockdown - public transportation is suspended, non-essential businesses must be closed or simply <strong>everyone should stay at home</strong>.</p>
<p>But working on a media and broadcasting field, yet being the transmitter engineers, we can&rsquo;t help but think: <em>Uhm, how about us?</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, it took almost 2 days to formulize measures for us; don&rsquo;t get me wrong, we wanted to be safe, but being the <em>essential</em> skeletal personnel in the operations of news source, and in my own opinion, we had to keep the broadcast on-air.</p>
<p>To reduce public exposure, we were assigned a 7-day work-week and 7-day home-rest during the quarantine imposed by the government. During the work-week, we can stay in office (which we do most of the time) - this also to avoid the public.</p>
<p>So as of now, I am still on my rest-week, reading programming books, self-help books, watching some Netflix, downloaded movies, playing some Minecraft and exercise, of course. I sometimes go outside to buy some essential stuffs, but sadly, there are still a lot of people on the main streets. Worse, not social-distancing. God help us.</p>
<p>There is also this viral in social media right now comparing, lest, swapping their local Mayors for not acting amidst the pandemic. It makes me laugh but at times like these, it can be a serious matter where we should learn not to vote the incompetent leaders.</p>
<p>We still don&rsquo;t know how will this affect our monetary status. But we are pretty sure our savings will be affected. If you can, you can help me stay safe and secure at home:</p>
<p>Donate maybe? 🙂 Thank you.</p>

    <title>A Story of Self-taught Coding</title>

                <img src="/images/ard-and.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>Started coding using VB.Net and Forms for our final year thesis (which programming was NOT a major). Then while gearing up for board exams, learnt to code and design for Windows Phone 7.5/7.8/8 using XAML, C# &amp; Silverlight.</p>
<p>Then came Windows 8.1 and WP8.1 on the Univeral App Shared codes, but didn&rsquo;t dive that deep because of some weird Windows 8.1 windowing and such.</p>
<p>Finally W10 and UWP, still slowly learning and managed to improve my coding skills.</p>
<p>Most of my WP7/8 apps were unpublished due to failure to update them, but right now a set of Windows 10 Apps is available for download. I have yet to get my own domain though.</p>
<p>And since, Windows (dev) has no feature to share a publisher link, I&rsquo;d share my Facebook page: <a href="https://facebook.com/reddavidapps">https://facebook.com/reddavidapps</a></p>
