# OBS Studio 27 is here


I just updated my OBS a few days ago with the official release version after trying out the several release candidates.

I will talk about the new features and improvements here that will be useful for my use. Check their blog post <a href="https://obsproject.com/blog/obs-studio-27-released" target="_blank">here</a> and the complete changelog <a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/27.0.0" target="_blank">here.</a>

# Undo & Redo (5000)

At last! No more annoyances when you just ACCIDENTALLY move something on the canvas. Undo and redo is here for every change you do in your sources and scenes - not sure for all filters though. And that’s 5000 actions.

Though I mostly use OBS for game streaming (no facecam), I move things around only to notice that it was not the source I wanted to move! This surely helps users out and always had been the most requested feature.

# Files, where?

Version 27 also added a missing files window prompt on launch that allows us to relocate or ignore the missing files. Nice addition so we don’t go start streaming only to have the files missing.

# No More Noise

OBS v27 for Windows now adds NVIDIA Noise Removal as an option to audio Noise Suppression filter when the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-sdk/resources/" target="_blank">NVIDIA Audio Effects SDK</a> is installed. Oh, also you need an NVIDIA RTX GPU for that - so no screenshots from me.

# Improvements

Thanks for these 2 new improvements among others:

- Browser Source interact button (toolbar)
- Virtual Camera toggle button (system tray)

# Fin

This new version of OBS Studio definitely helps with the new added features. Now I want a selective record feature.

I use OBS Studio together with <a href="https://streamelements.com/" target="_blank">StreamElements</a> OBS Live to simplify my stream setup to Facebook Gaming. I now have 1,019 followers (as of this writing) and why not check me out there? Maybe talk about gaming, life, or programming? <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG/" target="_blank">RedDavidGG on Facebook Gaming</a>

I dedicate the starwall page for my stars-sender. Thanks and make sure to check out OBS Studio’s latest release <a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank">here.</a>
