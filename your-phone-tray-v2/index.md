# Your Phone Tray V2


Your Phone Tray UWP app just got updated.

Version 2.0 brings few UI changes, some improvements and a breaking change.

### Improvements
To improve the app, I updated the tray icon context menu to show that it should be running on Startup (see Task Manager Start up)

You can also see a new menu item <strong>Enable Ctrl+Y Hotkey</strong>. If enabled, the app silently picks up the Ctrl+Y shortcut to open Your Phone app. It can be toggled if the shortcut key messes up some of your programs.

### Breaking change
Microsoft's Your Phone app has been updated several times that launching it directly to the photos section shows a blank UI. For the meantime, all shortcuts to open the app will direct to messages.
