After being canceled and waiting for more than 2 years it is now happening, without an audience in Bucharest, Romania with a total prizepool of $40M+.</p>

<p>I only play the game against custom BOT scripts ðŸ¤£ just to past time or just to be updated with what patches <a href="https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/IceFrog" target="_blank">IceFrog</a> brings to the game. What I mostly do is watch major tournaments especially those when teams need to earn <a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Dota_Pro_Circuit" target="_blank">DPC points</a> for entering the prestigious TI.</p>
<h2 id="10-days-of-dota">10 Days of DOTA</h2>
<p>#TI10 started on October 7th with 18 qualified teams playing playoffs on the group stage to determine their position either on the upper or lower bracket; and where two teams: Thunder Predator and SG, in the end, bid farewell for the Main Stage and championship.</p>

<p>Now, as of this writing, we just ended Day 3 of the Main Stage and I&rsquo;ve followed and watched most of the games. Fnatic, a SEA team with 2 Pinoy players, got eliminated on Day 2 just after getting past a heart-wrenching Best-of-One&rsquo;s on the Lower Bracket the day before. The last SEA representative, T1, would have to give their best on their lower bracket run.</p>

<p>Watching all games and supporting SEA teams, my heart still goes to Team Secret for all their TI runs. Right now, they already secured Top 3 finish for the semifinals game against PSG.LGD.</p>

<p>I follow the games by watching <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/singsing" target="_blank">singsing&rsquo;s Twitch stream</a> as he and his (pepega) friends cast and analyze the stream - chill and fun. This way I can watch (or listen) while doing app coding.</p>
<h2 id="coding-and-appdates">Coding and Appdates</h2>
<p>This 10-day tournament meant a break from me streaming (to catch the games) which then allowed me time to code for RPN News mobile app.</p>
<p>My job (finally) provided me a Samsung A71 Android phone to test the app (and for work-related stuff) after my old personal phone went bust; though I still use my iPhone 11 to test the iOS code - maybe soon? ðŸ¤£</p>
<figure><figcaption>
            <p>Samsung A71</p>

<p>The app has been up on the Google Play Store for some time (as I blogged <a href="https://reddavid.me/rpn-android-app/" target="_blank">here</a>) and lacked significant updates. It stayed that way for a while until all busy-ness and code-confusion (is this even a term?) has subsided.</p>
<p>These past days, I managed to release an update for the Android beta app and also started a TestFlight for iOS devices.</p>
<p>I decided to version the app as 2.0 as this was a complete rework from the old code despite not publicly releasing a version 1.0. The app was previously coded on C#/Xamarin Forms but the documentation and support I needed was &ldquo;not there&rdquo;, then I started to code on Dart/Flutter for RPN Radio which made things easier - being a single-codebase mobile app development.</p>
<p>Version 2.0 brings a new UI and supports offline mode - see downloaded news (as opposed to before that it will not work when there is no internet; though it is always recommended to be connected to get the latest news).</p>

    <title>Mobile Game Streaming</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/mobile-game-streaming/</link>

    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/feat/codm-fbgg-streaming.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>This is a post to ask my SMP members to forgive by not playing for a while (a week) on our Minecraft server. I will also share my setup how I stream mobile games.</p>
<h1 id="grind-to-legend">Grind to Legend</h1>
<p>Ever since the new season of Call of Duty: Mobile came out, I just wanted to redeem the legendary medal. And also to get all rewards from the Battle Pass I bought. ðŸ˜‚</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry guys and gals, kuya Red will be back soon. Konti na lang back to Legendary rank na sa BR mode at pwede na mag-Minecraft.</p>
<figure><figcaption>
            <h4>Locked Legendary Rank</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h1 id="minecraft-117-is-out">Minecraft 1.17 is out</h1>
<p>Spigot 1.17 is out and is now available as an option for our server but the plugins are currently unsupported, so we&rsquo;ll stick to 1.16.5. Though I played the snapshots and pre-releases, I am still yet to play Minecraft 1.17 Vanilla.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0maWbr0FHKY" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>The caves and cliffs update (part 1) brings new items and features which were detailed on Minecraft&rsquo;s own blog <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/updates/caves-and-cliffs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now on to my setup.</p>
<h1 id="setup">Setup</h1>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s see the devices I use except for the laptop/PC for streaming.</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone 11</li>
<li>Lightning to AV Digital Adapter</li>
<li>HDMI cable</li>
<li>Cheap video capture</li>
<li>Audio-technica Condenser Mic</li>
</ul>
<p>I used to play on my Nokia 7 Plus but can&rsquo;t the specs can&rsquo;t keep up, not sure why. This is when I use <a href="https://www.vysor.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vysor</a>, a screen mirroring app that wirelessly share the phone&rsquo;s screen to the PC. Now, that&rsquo;s where the problem is, wireless mirroring makes the sound delayed that playing action games is not a good experience. I invested in both an iPhone and the adapter since I can use them on future projects - software development.</p>
<figure><figcaption>
            <h4>Lightning to AV Adapter and USB Capture Card</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I wonder why branded capture cards are so damn expensive?! Like the <a href="https://ecommerce.datablitz.com.ph/products/elgato-hd60-s-game-capture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elgato HD60S</a> and <a href="https://ecommerce.datablitz.com.ph/products/avermedia-live-gamer-ultra-game-streaming-capture-box-gc553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AverMedia Live Gamer Ultra</a>. So I went ahead and bought a $6 (300 pesos) unbranded USB capture card and it just works fine. Just stick it well on a USB port and it&rsquo;s good to go.</p>
<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3o6MbtelsDZdsbFB7i" width="480" height="360" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto;"></iframe>
<p>Lastly, I recently bought an <a href="https://www.audio-technica.com/en-gb/atr2500x-usb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ATR-2500X condenser mic</a> to record songs and guitars for my YouTube channel. Now it&rsquo;s multi-purpose that I use it on my streams and Zoom meetings.</p>
<figure><figcaption>
            <h4>Audio-Technica ATR2500X Condenser Mic</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>As for the software, I use <a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OBS Studio</a>. I had a bad experience using SLOBS, it freezes and crashes over simple things. I used to do overlays with Streamlabs but then I found StreamElements OBS.Live. It makes things much easier with a direct &ldquo;Go Live&rdquo; button on OBS Studio, chat box, and activity feed. They also provide a nice overlay editor with text-to-speech system on their <a href="https://streamelements.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>.</p>
<figure><figcaption>
            <h4>StreamElements OBS.Live Plugin</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="diagram">Diagram</h2>
<p>This is how my setup is connected. Remember that you need an internet with at least 4000kbps of upload speed to actually stream your games on Facebook Gaming (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/fbgaminghome/creators/getstarted" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>). I stream at 1080p60 with 6000kbps bitrate.</p>
<figure><figcaption>

<h1 id="games-list">Games List</h1>
<p>I have a few mobile games on my phone right now compared to my <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/reddvid/games/?tab=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Library</a>. But I own some mobile-worthy games like Stardew Valley and Minecraft: Pocket Edition.</p>
<p>I have a love and hate relationship with games like PUBG Mobile and Mobile Legends. I am looking forward to Apex Legends: Mobile and Diablo Immortal though. They&rsquo;re both are already in beta preview on Android, currently waiting for the iPhone/iPad version.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.me/reddavidgg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Send me a message</a> to request a game I can play. Or we can play together.</p>
<h1 id="support-me-on-facebook-gaming">Support me on Facebook Gaming</h1>
<p>This seems repetitive but I do need some support when I go live. It feels like streaming and talking to friends is now an everyday duty, haha. But kidding aside, everyone needs help.</p>
<p>Check me <a href="https://fb.gg/reddavidgg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and let&rsquo;s talk more about tech and things.</p>

    <title>Unlocked: 1K Followers</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/unlocked-1k-followers/</link>
    <pubDate>Sat, 29 May 2021 22:26:48 &#43;0800</pubDate><dc:creator>David</dc:creator><guid>https://reddavid.me/unlocked-1k-followers/</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/feat/1k-followers.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>First of all, thank you so much to all who stayed, watched, and enjoyed my content.</p>
<p>It was on May 26th that we finally got to a thousand following after a year of starting to be a Gaming Video Creator on Facebook. The stream felt like another day of chill streaming by playing a couple of hours of Minecraft. It was quite overwhelming for a small-time (and not full-time) streamer like me but thanks to my cousins and og supporters for helping me out in the chat and Discord server.</p>
<figure class="image">

</figure>
<br/>
<h1 id="strikedailystrike-nightly-streams"><strike>Daily</strike> Nightly Streams</h1>
<p>Now that there&rsquo;s that 1K following behind me, I will pursue to stream on a daily basis, even a short one because honestly, I miss talking and updating with them. I will also continue to improve my stream quality.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="not-minecraft-hello">Not Minecraft, Hello?</h1>
<p>Minecraft is a really popular game we all know that, and most of my followers were because of the game. I do not expect everyone to like me playing variety of games but I still hope most could support me when I come back playing other types of games. Although, I would still join our SMP server if I fail to stream Minecraft.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="twitchyoutube-switch">Twitch/YouTube Switch</h1>
<p>Yes, I have been thinking of switching to either one, why? First, Twitch have several audience interaction which I have been using when I watch my favorite streamers there like, watch points, play with viewers, etc and you can watch on app minimized.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Watch Twitch Videos Minimized</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>While YouTube had a better chat system, but chat highlights and audience interactions are better - with chatbots.</p>
<p>I held back these thoughts before since I did start my Facebook page a long time and gained a few followers. I just hoped if I made up my mind to switch, we can determine the real supporters. Maybe?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for this blog post. Thank you again for visiting my website and you can catch up on my Gaming Videos on <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook Gaming</a> and follower me there. You can also follow me on my socials: @reddvid</p>

    <title>Streaming Again &amp; Minecraft SMP Season 2</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/minecraft-smp-season-2/</link>
    <pubDate>Sun, 18 Apr 2021 02:52:30 &#43;0800</pubDate><dc:creator>David</dc:creator><guid>https://reddavid.me/minecraft-smp-season-2/</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/feat/mc-smp-s02.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>Rejoice! My more-than-a-month-long hiatus finally came to an end - I&rsquo;m back to streaming video games in Facebook Gaming. In just 2 days, I&rsquo;ve managed to garner a whopping 8+ hours as compared before.</p>
<p>This also means that I am back to relieving some stress thru my beloved game Minecraft, (Survival Mode).</p>
<h1 id="first-world">First World?</h1>
<p>The first server I rented became <strike>toxic</strike> unenjoyable after a few months after opening it into the public - NO it&rsquo;s not because of the new players, but because the server was technically &ldquo;DONE&rdquo; by having usable XP farms, stripped mines, food source, and other auto AFK farms. Which meant that new players have nothing more to do but mess around most of the time.</p>
<p>I tried to reload the server with a new world but it kept corrupting upto the point that I reverted it back to the older (toxic) world. And I stopped playing less and less.</p>
<h1 id="refreshed-and-new-season-two">Refreshed and New? SEASON TWO</h1>
<p>Yes, after I decided to stream again, I hastily rented a new server and invite some of my OG followers to play with me. As of now, the world is still peaceful and managed to invite more players in hoping we can live happily in the upcoming days.</p>
<p>Unlike before, the server is now Offline-mode, meaning that non-Mojang accounts can now join - be CAREFUL though, WE CAN STILL <strong>BAN</strong> YOU.</p>
<h2 id="wanna-join">Wanna join?</h2>
<p>Head over to our Discord server for the rules and guidelines, and for the Server IP.</p>
<p><a href="https://discord.gg/rKnJb4J" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red David Discord Server</a></p>

<p>Hosted by Shockbyte, cheap and reliable servers are offered for you. Check them out <a href="https://bit.ly/ShockByteMC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<h1 id="hello-1k-followers">Hello 1K Followers</h1>
<p>I have been aiming to reach followers before the year 2020 ends but I failed to do so, much more that I stopped streaming for more than a month.</p>
<p>Now with regained confidence, I am on the path to reach that goal while improving my streaming. So head over to my <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook Gaming Page</a> and see if you like me to gain a Follow!</p>
<h1 id="looking-for-support">âœ¨Looking for Support</h1>
<p>Also, I tried streaming mobile games now and then but the current setup is not suited for it. I am slowly building funds to get the setup for mobile games too.</p>
