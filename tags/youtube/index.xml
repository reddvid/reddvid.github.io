            </div><p>First of all, thank you so much to all who stayed, watched, and enjoyed my content.</p>
<p>It was on May 26th that we finally got to a thousand following after a year of starting to be a Gaming Video Creator on Facebook. The stream felt like another day of chill streaming by playing a couple of hours of Minecraft. It was quite overwhelming for a small-time (and not full-time) streamer like me but thanks to my cousins and og supporters for helping me out in the chat and Discord server.</p>

<p>Now that there&rsquo;s that 1K following behind me, I will pursue to stream on a daily basis, even a short one because honestly, I miss talking and updating with them. I will also continue to improve my stream quality.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="not-minecraft-hello">Not Minecraft, Hello?</h1>
<p>Minecraft is a really popular game we all know that, and most of my followers were because of the game. I do not expect everyone to like me playing variety of games but I still hope most could support me when I come back playing other types of games. Although, I would still join our SMP server if I fail to stream Minecraft.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="twitchyoutube-switch">Twitch/YouTube Switch</h1>
<p>Yes, I have been thinking of switching to either one, why? First, Twitch have several audience interaction which I have been using when I watch my favorite streamers there like, watch points, play with viewers, etc and you can watch on app minimized.</p>

<br/>
<p>While YouTube had a better chat system, but chat highlights and audience interactions are better - with chatbots.</p>
<p>I held back these thoughts before since I did start my Facebook page a long time and gained a few followers. I just hoped if I made up my mind to switch, we can determine the real supporters. Maybe?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for this blog post. Thank you again for visiting my website and you can catch up on my Gaming Videos on <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook Gaming</a> and follower me there. You can also follow me on my socials: @reddvid</p>
