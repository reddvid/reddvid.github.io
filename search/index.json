[{"content":"As you might have noticed, I haven\u0026rsquo;t blogged in more than a month (since April 27th). So here are some highlights and what has happened:\nOuting before May First week I got to join an outing to a private pool to unwind. The travel is quite a pain since it was on a Friday night. It was a simple company get-together but so glad I came.\nElection Season We are yet again elect the two of the highest positions of the government and I got a week off from work (too bad they won\u0026rsquo;t let me have a laptop - so I could at least check back when needed). I got to spend my mom\u0026rsquo;s 50th birthday (again on a location with a pool) where I emcee\u0026rsquo;d for a bit.\nGoing home also means I got to eat better and healthier. So sad I spent most inside since it was extremely hot on our place - so I got to continue reading some books.\nReading Books As said on a previous blog post, I finished Atomic Habits and finished another two books: Outliers and Essentialism. Reading this three books made me make some changes in my life especially with Essentialism which particularly affected my focus - in work, play, and life.\nI began journaling daily activities, avoid doing \u0026ldquo;unessential\u0026rdquo; things, and take and \u0026ldquo;think\u0026rdquo; things slow.\nMy reading list as of now:\n The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck Everything is F*cked Zero to One Designing for Work  My reading is on and off to \u0026ldquo;accommodate\u0026rdquo; other things like taking short online courses on Udemy, doing some coding courses, and of course doing essential work.\nPlans? I\u0026rsquo;ll go ahead and say I might not be posting again anytime soon (or maybe if motivation comes) since I am keeping my self busy with work, and \u0026ldquo;essential\u0026rdquo; activities. I also stopped playing video games which is sad but it also means I get to read books or code.\nMastering dotnet Took so long but I think I really get to at least master .NET and C#.\nManage Myself Just think about it yourself.\nTie the Knot Getting closer to October for a new chapter.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it for me, May went by so fast and it\u0026rsquo;s now June, I\u0026rsquo;m getting older in a few days.\n","date":"2022-06-08T03:12:03+08:00","image":"https://reddavid.me/life-updates/life-update_hu38cdad13c523f9a05790312822e49b36_15323_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://reddavid.me/life-updates/","title":"Life Updates"},{"content":"A new coding adventure begins! I always wanted to get deep with JavaScript specifically NodeJS to build apps and I never got into it due to confusion into what it is, what it can do, what UI framework to use. Though in this phase of learning NodeJS, I skipped building the UI since the bot is all code.\nLet’s get into it!\nIntro Why build a bot from scratch? Most free Discord bots out there does a wide-range of tasks from automessaging, ping/share Twitch links, play music, XP level system, but the features are somehow pay-to-use and managing more than 2 bots is somehow distracting for my small server.\nI also was encouraged after building a very simple NodeJS app that changes my custom status on Discord with a single button using Flutter and Discord user token.\nBuilding with DiscordJS Before doing the actual code, I got overwhelmed with more coding jargons like OAuth, tokens, intents, etc. - since I haven’t really used them in my personal projects. And ever since coding with C# and/or Flutter/Dart, building apps with their respective documentation, examples, and playground makes it easier, which then means that getting started with DiscordJS somewhat confused me at first.\nCreate a Bot and Get It’s Token This should be fairly easy to get, head over to Discord Developer Portal and build an application/bot. Note: The tutorials online might be a little outdated from what the settings.\nInstall NodeJS This should be included in Windows installation really but they have guide online. Be careful, installing node may produce errors on terminal due to a bug in setting environment path.\nUse VSCode Please.\nBot Capabilities As of this writing, here are a few capabilities I put on my Discord bot:\n Welcome message to new members Farewell message to tell who left Twitch Ping - sends a message when I go live YouTube Ping - sends a message when I post a new video on my gaming channel Roles selection via emojis Few slash commands XP and Level system  Heroku Deployment Running the app locally works but it’s not good practice so I once learned a new platform/service with Heroku, it hosts and deploys NodeJS apps for free which allows my bot to run online.\nCodes? I will share the codes/tutorial soon but this post will just serve as an announcement or invitation to share what I have been doing lately.\nTry It Out Shamelessly, you can join our Discord community, it now houses people who watches my gaming streams, likes my coding, and just a place to hangout for friends and family.\nJoin our Discord Community, Bahay ni Kuya\n","date":"2022-04-27T02:03:51+08:00","image":"https://reddavid.me/building-my-own-discord-bot/alfred-bot_hu14c4e16b3c252fc8f047840db42ced03_60649_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://reddavid.me/building-my-own-discord-bot/","title":"Building My Own Discord Bot"},{"content":"Windows Live Recorded Event I was just anticipating a single event at 11PM and it was Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Windows Powers the Future of Hybrid Work live (recorded) event.\nThey announced security improvements and new features coming later this year focused first on businesses.

It\u0026rsquo;s an expensive piece of a great tech which I never thought I needed.\nI hesitated to get one before because of the price but until I knew that the deck can be used just fine without the \u0026ldquo;unchangeable\u0026rdquo; height stand. And also, the time-save it can bring definitely helps in daily tasks.\nUnboxing, where? Unfortunately, I never got to take a video or even photos of the unboxing. The box contains the device, the detachable USB-C cable, and the stand. Sadly, it does not include a free faceplate to interchange the default black plain plate.\nSetting Up The device requires the Stream Deck application to actually setup what actions the buttons will do.\n Stream Deck Software\n  There are also lots of useful community-made plugins inside the Stream Deck\u0026rsquo;s Store that you will find very useful.\n Plugins Store\n  Setting the device is technically easy but I felt that some icon designs (the ones I needed) are very basic and were not standard.\nSo I try to make my own minimal but on-context (for me) icons.\nMaking Custom Icons After reading Elgato\u0026rsquo;s Style Guide Documentation for making Stream Deck Icons, I decided to start doing my key icons.\n   Icon Size @2x     Key Icon 72x72 px 144x144 px    Elgato's Key Icon standard size\rThankfully, I use Figma for wireframing/designing graphics so it is the best tool to create these icons.

Now I am aiming to light up every Github contribution grid block whenever I can.\nUpdating Flutter Packages The first thing I did was to check for updated packages from pub.dev by using flutter pub upgrade\nThen most are already outdated and forced some to major versions withflutter pub upgrade \u0026ndash;major-versions\nAlso, I tried to use Android Studio for Flutter programming and it took a little while again to get used to keyboard shortcuts coming from VS Code.\nLike the usual Alt + Shift + F to format code, now I have to use two hands for Ctrl + Shift + L. Also the shortcut for navigating to implementations F12 on VS Code, it\u0026rsquo;s now Ctrl + Alt + B. Heck, I can\u0026rsquo;t be bothered wasting time to remap those shortcut keys\u0026hellip;\nDespite the hassle above, Flutter coding in Android Studio also has awesome perks like: better debugging, better error checking by highlighting files with errors, faster navigation to files, assets manager and Intellisense. Though Android SDK management is still a pain in the a**. Change my mind.\nNew Code My project files were all over the place, so I finally bothered to refactor some files to proper folders like putting model classes to a model folder, services to services folder, etc.  Refactoring files to folders\n  Upgrading packages with at least 3 versions above since the app\u0026rsquo;s last update brought so much changes. Honestly I followed this open source project (Flutter Audio Service Demo) from GitHub and slightly modified/refactor the codes to minimize and actually use the code my app will only use.\nFutures I also updated the app with a new feature to fetch sponsors' ad placement images from a URL then view them when they are actually present in the contract - I used JSON to fetch the data. I faced a problem decoding it when I faced this unfamiliar type Map\u0026lt;String, dynamic\u0026gt; coming from a C# perspective.\nI managed to get it to work but a new issue appeared, two tasks are being awaited even the UI is now visible which made two variables null when they are still being done, making some unwanted behaviors.\nThen I finally used a Future Builder, it basically waits my tasks to finish fetching data before showing the main UI preventing further actions that require the variables.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11  return FutureBuilder( future: Future.wait([isLiveList(), getImages()]), builder: (context, AsyncSnapshot\u0026lt;List\u0026lt;dynamic\u0026gt;\u0026gt; snapshot) { if (snapshot.hasData) { final liveList = snapshot.data[0]; final adsList = snapshot.data[1]; return MainUI(); // Omitted for brevity  } else { return loadingScreen(); // Omitted for brevity  } });   ExpansionList and Swiper Now I need to add a feature for the app to show a carousel/auto-scrolling of images after being checked if it\u0026rsquo;s on the database - now it\u0026rsquo;s based off a .json file.\nAs stated above, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if Flutter/Dart preferred indexing a List by using a Map and not a number-index. So I poorly crammed the codes online to fetch the json, decode to objects, index, and list the image names.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  Future\u0026lt;Map\u0026lt;String, dynamic\u0026gt;\u0026gt; getImages() async { Map\u0026lt;String, dynamic\u0026gt; values; final response = await http.get(Uri.parse(\u0026#34;https://...ads.json\u0026#34;)); if (response.statusCode == 200) { // If the call to the server was successful, parse the JSON  values = json.decode(response.body); return values; } }   Before adding the view though, I thought heavily on where to put it avoiding the user to a second page. Somehow this is what I went for:\n Sponsors View using ExpansionTile and Swiper\n  Sponsors View using ExpansionTile and Swiper\nI used ExpansionTile to allow the users to collapse/expand the view and Swiper to show an auto-scroll of the images.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the code for the Sponsors UI:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32  ExpansionTile( title: Text( \u0026#39;Sponsors\u0026#39;, ), textColor: Colors.white, collapsedTextColor: Colors.white, iconColor: Colors.white, children: [ Padding( padding: EdgeInsets.only(bottom: 20.0), child: ConstrainedBox( constraints: new BoxConstraints.loose( new Size(MediaQuery.of(context).size.width, 280.0)), child: new Swiper( autoplay: true, autoplayDelay: 10000, itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) { return CachedNetworkImage( imageUrl: imageUrl, fit: BoxFit.fitHeight, width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width * 0.60, ); }, itemCount: adsList[stationNames[_nowPlayingIndex]].length, pagination: new SwiperPagination(), ))), ], )   To-Do It\u0026rsquo;s hard work but I would look to further clean and optimize the code.\n Do not use Swiper when image list is only 1 Improve loading screen during FutureBuilder Handle “offline” connection  ","date":"2022-03-31T00:44:04+08:00","image":"https://reddavid.me/updating-rpnradio-mobile-app/rpnradio-updates-feat_hueb127ff031487726c705b3daa2310954_30232_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://reddavid.me/updating-rpnradio-mobile-app/","title":"Updating RPN Radio Mobile App"},{"content":"Despite the fact that we do not have spring season in the Philippines, it is just good to clean and/or organize (this time) our digital life.\nHonestly, I am lazy af to clean things on a regular basis since I really suck at scheduling. This happens often when I get caught doing things that require a pretty good amount of focus (or am I just giving reasons for my laziness?)\nBit of My Digital History If you didn\u0026rsquo;t know, I started my computer life at the early age of 9/10? I just remember I was in grade 5, 1997-ish, when I fell in love with computers. But with the lack of internet, I only grew up into video games and not programming. I just picked up programming during college days when I was actually bought a laptop by my parents.\nWe tackled a bunch of languages even being an Electronics Engineering student, like C++, Turbo C, and Java. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t felt good about those languages until our thesis days where I got help with a friend, an IT student, using VB.Net. I slightly understood it better than the latter ones. It was also the start of programming in C#.Net for my Windows Phone to make apps.\nFiles Being into the Windows environment, files did matter and I actually had free 15GB of SkyDrive (OneDrive now) where I put my files in. While working, I actually preferred to use my laptop since it got more power than what they provide.\nNow with more than 8 years, my cloud is cluttered and having to use extensive apps, software, and services means there are alot more files scattered everywhere.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s go organizing.\nOrganizing Personal Files I suck at organizing back in the day that I actually did not create folders to group similar files.\nNow I slowly group and organize files and folders properly. Starting with the Documents and Pictures folder. Although my Documents folder still sucks since Windows games create their own saves folder which makes the list longer and hard to group.\nIn the Pictures folder, I began grouping photos and videos based on Year \u0026gt; Month, while other non-sense images went into an Archives folder or Others folder.\nFor my Personal folder, I grouped files by type and use:\n\r|--Ebooks\n|--Archive\n|--Graphics\n|--Family\n|--Art\n|--Stream Assets\n\rThen the files go into further folders like inside Stream Assets:\n\r|--Stream Assets\n\u0026emsp;|--Game Wallpapers\n\u0026emsp;|--Media\n\u0026emsp;|--Stingers\n\u0026emsp;|--Emotes\n\rWork Files This seems easier to organize by grouping files based on the responsibility/project, so I just went into choosing a better way to name work files. Continue reading below.\nFile Naming I started renaming work files since collaboration and sharing may require some context on the date and file versions:\nDocuments (docx, pdf, pptx, xlsx, etc) YYYY-MM-DD_TYPE_File_Name_Version#.extension\n2022-03-29_REPORT_Some_Incident_With_The_Clock.docx\nGraphics/Media Files (jpg, png, psd, mp3, mp4 etc) I use the dash and underscore interchangeably but I am more inclined to use underscore for consistency:\nfile_name_tags.extension or tags_file_name.extension or both\nad_magic_stylus_square_720x720.png open_graph_styled_frame_template.ai\nCodes Depending on the programming language, I strictly use their naming conventions/standard for clarity and consistency. But with other types like json, txt, and other asset files:\nfile_name.extension\nproducts_list.json\nsecret_codes.txt\nCloud All these files now live in the cloud, OneDrive specifically, and reformatting or changing machine makes it easier to get the files again. Less hassle and worries especially when a big part of my life depends on some important files.\nI am subscribed to Microsoft 365 Personal which offers 1TB of cloud storage and as of now I use around 48%.\nSign up to OneDrive and get 500MB additional storage space.\nShare Your Way So that\u0026rsquo;s about my file naming and folder organization and it is still on-going as of this writing.

But the days do really come fast when the holidays are coming and vacation leave plans make you do work in crunch time.\nFinale 2021 Luckily, we survived another year of the grueling pandemic and the local government did lower the Alert Level to a much more free movements in public - children can now go out with adults in malls. The holidays compared to last 2020 felt better.\nThe 24th and 25th I decided to celebrate Christmas Eve with my fiancée\u0026rsquo;s family with a fantastic dinner.\nGoing back about people being free last year, I also spent with her family on Christmas day. After hearing the Holy Mass, we were supposed to go picnic at Luneta Park but hoooly moly, the place was packed with people!\n\rThere should have been a video here but your browser does not seem\rto support it.\r\rLuneta Park on December 25th\r We arrived actually to a long line of newcomers until a sudden rain poured down that those without umbrellas, (inside and outside the park) came together where there\u0026rsquo;s shelter.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s when they decided to go to SM Mall of Asia instead.\nAnd just like going to the park, there were also traffic jams traveling to the mall.\nDespite expecting a lot of people, the mall was huge enough to contain them, except for restaurants at that time that most are full.\nAfter some time having to get dinner, we decided to go to the mall park to check and might try some rides. And that\u0026rsquo;s where we found that it\u0026rsquo;s also packed and they won\u0026rsquo;t let us enter anymore. Sadge, we went home and ended the day.\n MOA Eye Crowd on December 25th\n  Before the Year Ended I went home 3 days early for New Years Eve with my old friend Dave. He invited me to join him for the long drive home.\nSadly, my fiancée can\u0026rsquo;t join me at ours because they would also be going back home.\nI always try to go home days early to spend time with friends making the last few days actually spent time with the family.\nSadly again, we failed to meet up. And just like before, there\u0026rsquo;ll be a next time. Right?\nOn the 30th, the family went to Tondaligan Beach early in the morning as it would get really hot even at 9 in the morning.\n I 💗 Tondaligan Beach\n  New Year Eve I don\u0026rsquo;t remember if I helped out in food preparations 😂.\nThe New Year\u0026rsquo;s Eve always start early by drinking liquor, listening to loud music, karaoke, etc.\nThere were lots of fireworks compared to last year and people looked a lot more hopeful for the coming year.  Food for New Year\u0026rsquo;s Eve\n  Year 2021 Part 2  Some said it\u0026rsquo;s going to be another version of 2021 but worse. News in the first week included shortage of acetaminophen (paracetamol) in most drugstores, at least in the NCR.\nA lot got sick after the holidays and mostly believed that it was flu season. But it was also reported that the then latest COVID variant, omicron, causes slight mild symptoms similarly to a flu. But then a few days went on and the COVID-19 numbers started to rise up.\nBack to the Jungle I actually returned to work on the second week of the first month. I took an antigen test and it came negative.\nI worked on Monday, the day after the test feeling really well, but then came Tuesday afternoon. My energy just went kaput.\nDownhill. Just. Like. That.\nI Got the Bad V Bad vibes, I really think it\u0026rsquo;s the bad virus.\nThat day, I just ate a hefty lunch normally, drank coffee and went on to start the day (I wake up after noon). After a few hours, Inbecame suddenly weak and drowsy. I also felt being cold even in a jacket. I started checking my temperature and it started rising up.\nI quickly prepared my things to go home, to my fiancé\u0026rsquo;s. Her room was isolated and kept me locked in most of the time. I took some meds to lower my temperature but it didn\u0026rsquo;t work. It continues to rise up by the hour that I just left my undies on me to release the heat. It really is that high!\nThe fever came with a massive headache and body pains that moving was a struggle. I kept taking meds every 4/5 hours to lower my temps and relief head and body aches. The first two nights were the height of all the symptoms. Lucky enough for those days, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have cough or colds that might release some infectious fluids.\nMy appetite never changed drastically during the 3-4 days of being sick. I ate well and drank a lot of water, continued taking meds for mild head and body aches, vitamins for my immune system, and basic exercises whenever I can.\nI am deeply grateful for her family that I am still alive right now. And I spent the rest of January in isolation playing Hollow Knight - which is an awesome game - and read a few books and watched online courses.\nHollow Knight  Transport Stag in Hollow Knight\n  This game is a metroidvania platformer which I actually played way before but gave up due to not having a proper gamepad controller - since the keyboard controls sucked for me.\nThe game started okay but when I finally met the bosses and how crazy the map navigation was, I was hooked. The game simply is not linear and you do have to explore the world for power ups and abilities that allows you to reach locations and do things you previously can\u0026rsquo;t on the way.\n Hallownest Map\n  For more than two weeks of isolation, I actually 100-percented the game all that time in isolation, up until now I can\u0026rsquo;t still quite believe I passed White Castle.\n\r\rI ended the game\u0026rsquo;s main ending with 106% completion. But wait, there were still two endings: the True Ending - killing the actual Boss Radiance, and Godhome Ending - a final fight with all bosses and an upgraded Radiance.\nAtomic Habits During isolation, I bought books online to read when Hollow Knight was hard enough that I take a few breaks. I rest my mind by reading James Clear\u0026rsquo;s Atomic Habits and also help me understand and change my habitual ways.  Atomic Habits by James Clear\n  Outliers Right in time going back to work, my next reading list was Malcolm Gladwell\u0026rsquo;s Outliers, I am half-way the book as of this writing.\n Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell\n  No Codes The first 2 months of 2022 was quite slow for me to return coding. I haven\u0026rsquo;t coded a lot due to holiday hangover and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do it sponteaneously to reduce trial and error, as I really wanted a smooth-sailing code when I begin.\nGoing Back to Work Getting back to work means grinding the tasks left during my sick days, especially the problems we\u0026rsquo;re having with the website\u0026rsquo;s database. All in all, I came back normally with no more symptoms and ready to take on the rest of the year.\nI also continued to play Hollow Knight and get the full 112% completion on rest days.\n\r\rFinal Words Prior to this post, I updated this website with a new Hugo theme. The theme Stack by Jimmy is smaller and basic compared to the previous one, CodeIT. I had to edit some parts like better open graph handling, custom layouts, fonts, page views, etc. I also had to do cleaning due to different framework style like PhotoSwipe images, different link render, frontmatter, and url slugs - which took most of the time.\nThat ends this update for me, stay safe and wear a mask.\nFeatured image Hollow Knight style by Prashant Mohta\n","date":"2022-03-16T02:43:53+08:00","image":"https://reddavid.me/new-in-2022/2022-update-og_hud19524b6314e4d98b967c86efc1d321c_697275_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://reddavid.me/new-in-2022/","title":"Looking New in 2022"},{"content":"Update #2 RPN News mobile app is now also available to download from Huawei AppGallery.

See the download section below.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been a while again since my last post but there were no significant updates lately - besides another week-long vacation. So let me introduce this new mobile app from RPN that I developed and releasing now.\nDelays The app had a working beta for Android devices for awhile now with bare experience and a better update has been in the works. I took the time to work out the database functions, UI and UX, and some other features (mobile ads, and customized links).\nI apologize for the delay but I just made sure these features are working for production.\nApp Details Most brands nowadays accompany their line of business with a mobile app, beside the RPN Radio app which was released so much earlier, I am now finally be able to bring news mobile app for Android devices, and iPhones.\nRight now, the app is a feed for the provincial news as visible on RPN website. The news are gathered by our provincial/regional news stations that you can read from the website or from the app - for much easier reading and sharing.\nScreenshots It took too long to release the app that the version is now at 2.1. Below are screenshots (store previews for iPhone and Android).\n--\rNews feed (Android)\r\r\rNews feed (Android)\r\r\rNews details (Android)\r\r\rAbout page (Android)\r --\rDownload Here The app is available now on the Google Play Store: RPN News - Apps on Google Play\nUpdate #1: Download for iPhone here: RPN News on the App Store\nUpdate #2: Download from Huawei AppGallery: RPN News on Huawei AppGallery\nAs for Huawei devices (AppGallery) and iPhone App Store, the app is still under review for each platform. Will add the links as soon as they\u0026rsquo;re approved.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next Here are the milestones I am looking forward to bring:\nMilestone 2.2+  News Filter (by Station or tags) Search National and International news (courtesy of BusinessMirror news) Customizable fonts Read aloud  Milestone 3.0  Integrate stations' live videos (YouTube) Integrate stations' VODs (video-on-demand)  As always, you can follow me on Twitter for mini updates.\n","date":"2021-12-04T03:22:25+08:00","image":"https://reddavid.me/images/feat/rpn-news.png","permalink":"https://reddavid.me/rpnnews-mobile-app/","title":"(Update: Now Available on 3 Major App Stores) RPN News Mobile App"},{"content":"As you may know by now, I am an electronics engineer but currently and mostly doing IT stuff and some casual gaming. I can also describe myself as an on-a-budget tech enthusiast - I buy top-tier pc/laptop upgrades after some time since their release or when it\u0026rsquo;s affordable enough; like when I went for 1TB Samsung 970 EVO just to hold the apps, games, and files that I leave after testing them out.\nHaving said that, I sometimes stumble upon bad or corrupted files, deleted some system files, OR EVEN installing Windows sh*ttiest Insider builds. But I seldom hold myself back reverting or reinstalling Windows to clean everything up.\nThe Cloud Works I trust the cloud, at least with Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s OneDrive service. I have a 1TB subscription to hold my most important files (like assets for this website, etc.) and pictures. I also always keep in hand a Windows installer on a USB stick. With all the files backed up, I simply begin reformatting it and reinstall apps and software starting with these:\n\rWindows Apps This list may or may not be in order.\nAvast Driver Updater Since Windows 10, the OS also installs drivers, but I make sure they are updated using this software. It has a free trial and it works just fine. At this time, I also install graphics drivers (AMD Radeon Software or NVidia GeForce Experience).\nDownload: Avast Driver Updater \u0026amp; Scanner\nMicrosoft Office My subscription also contains a license to use the full desktop version of Microsoft Office, so it\u0026rsquo;s a win-win for me since this is an important skill personally and for work.\nProduct link: Office 365 Personal\nSteam Additionally, I don\u0026rsquo;t store my games to where my OS is installed. Steam and most game platforms allow us to locate game files, so I don\u0026rsquo;t have to redownload hundreds of GB game files.\nDownload: Steam\nBitwarden Ever since I experienced being hacked, I immediately started using a password manager/generator to make my passwords not the same - YES what a shame.\nDownload: Bitwarden\nWinRAR Compress and extract files and folders with unlimited 40 day trial.\nDownload: WinRAR\nSpotify Even though the lack of lossless audio format, Spotify is my go-to music service. Unless it came preinstalled with Windows.\nDownload links: Spotify (Microsoft Store) | Spotify (.exe setup)\nVoiceMeeter Banana (and Virtual Cable) One of the most useful audio mixers software out there, donationware and flexible for my needs. It allows me to mix and manage audio inputs and outputs for other communication apps.\nDownload: VoiceMeeter Banana\nVisual Studio Code I use this as a code editor for Flutter/Dart mobile development and other source codes like this blog.\nDownload: Visual Studio Code\nVisual Studio The full IDE software for various development cases. I mainly use it for Windows app development as I haven\u0026rsquo;t got into webapps as of now. I code and create apps using WinForms, WPF, and UWP (WinUI). I also tried Xamarin.Forms but I moved onto Flutter for cross-platform mobile app development.\nDownload: Visual Studio\nOBS Studio I used this for streaming, recording and virtual camera purposes. I now use OBS instead of XSplit. The software is FREE and much lightweight. It also has features and other free plugins made by the community.\nDownload: OBS Studio\nFigma Desktop App This free app is browser-based but can also be downloaded as a desktop app. It was made for designers to build UI/UX interfaces - which I sometimes do when making apps. I also use this to make quick and simple logos and other graphics.\nDownload: Figma Desktop\n\rNow on to mobile apps. I switched to iPhone nearly a year ago because of the hardware-and-software stability (in my opinion) and the support does not end after 2 or 3 years, unlike Android. So resetting my device (after a really really bad beta software) isn\u0026rsquo;t that much of a hassle because of iCloud backups.\nMobile Apps Here are my top apps that I use on a daily basis. I will not put the specific store page instead I will link to their website for mobile downloads (if available). I\u0026rsquo;ll list the apps I use on both platforms (PC and Mobile)\nSpotify Of course, we also listen to music on our phones. I can also control other playing devices' volume when AFK.\nBitwarden The app is quite simple and still got some UI bugs. Otherwise, I use this as my password manager for my phone.\nSteam I don\u0026rsquo;t often get a lot of chat from Steam but for a quicker view of what games are on sale, this app does it.\nMicrosoft Office, Outlook, and OneDrive I put them together here since they are not in a suite but the new Office app user-wise deprecated the standalone Word, Excel, and PowerPoint apps since you can view and edit your documents in one app.\nDownload links: Microsoft Office Mobile App | Outlook Mobile | OneDrive Mobile App\nTwitter Where I get updated to what\u0026rsquo;s happening. I only follow niche and some well-known \u0026ldquo;wholesome and awesome\u0026rdquo; Twitter users.\nDownload: Twitter\nFacebook Messenger Yup, most family members and friends are into messenger chats so that\u0026rsquo;s no escaping Facebook.\nGCash Globe Telecom\u0026rsquo;s virtual wallet, and is now available for all networks.\nYouTube and Reddit My other ways to consume online content.\nMicrosoft Edge Despite the sync being subpar to Google Chrome, I prefer this one as my main browser on my iPhone.\nDownload: Microsoft Edge Web Browser\nShopee Every once in a while (trust me 🤣) we just want to shop online. I recently deleted my Lazada account because it annoyed me so much with their shenanigans.\nDownload: Shopee PH\n So far these are my top apps that I use on my mobile phone.

It stayed that way for a while until all busy-ness and code-confusion (is this even a term?) has subsided.\nThese past days, I managed to release an update for the Android beta app and also started a TestFlight for iOS devices.\nI decided to version the app as 2.0 as this was a complete rework from the old code despite not publicly releasing a version 1.0. The app was previously coded on C#/Xamarin Forms but the documentation and support I needed was \u0026ldquo;not there\u0026rdquo;, then I started to code on Dart/Flutter for RPN Radio which made things easier - being a single-codebase mobile app development.\nVersion 2.0 brings a new UI and supports offline mode - see downloaded news (as opposed to before that it will not work when there is no internet; though it is always recommended to be connected to get the latest news).\nGet into the Beta Test The app is available for testing and I welcome your feedback after getting the app here from Google Play Store and Apple TestFlight.\nOr scan the QR code/s below:\n Google Play Store QR Code\n   Google Play Store QR Code\n  You may submit your feedback using built-in tools from Google or TestFlight, sending an email, or any on my socials.\nI will try my best to get the app working for a public release.\n That\u0026rsquo;s it for now folks, let\u0026rsquo;s watch and enjoy some Dota.\n","date":"2021-10-15T03:53:07+08:00","image":"https://reddavid.me/images/og/ti10-appdates.png","permalink":"https://reddavid.me/ti10-and-appdates/","title":"TI10 and Appdates"},{"content":"Well how about that?! I just said about how I am prone to procrastinating on my last blog post (over 2 months ago!) that I wanted to keep pisting at least once a week but guess what, I failed! 🥲\nThough it\u0026rsquo;s not laziness, I just didn\u0026rsquo;t have good stories to post since it is still a pandemic over here and I just got back to work after my 2 weeks vacation (ehem, 10 days since I still kept in touch with my responsibilities - online stuff).\nThere\u0026rsquo;s just nothing to share, I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\nBut here are some highlights these past 2 months (may or may not be in particular order):\nSleeping Early Visiting the province means that you MUST sleep early. Can\u0026rsquo;t do much when waking later in the day.\nCook Better Food I have been intending to cook a healthy meal long before but time constraints and marketing had been prevented me to do so.

It is a book about fighting resistance of doing art (a metaphor of doing what you REALLY love). It\u0026rsquo;s a short self-development book authored by Steven Pressfield, and later I found that it has sequels or whatever you call it: Do The Work and Turning Pro. Do The Work was originally published first but was updated (I think?) to be the follow-up of TWoA. As the book title says, when overcoming resistance DO THE WORK. Lastly, Turning Pro is about escaping the amateur life (of doing work).\nI also stumbled upon a website called mostrecommendedbooks.com, a website where you can find a list of books which top personalities and celebrities had read. Some notable personalities I leisurely checked: Barack Obama, Bill Gates, Elon Musk (this man is futuristic and really into tech!), Dwayne \u0026ldquo;The Rock\u0026rdquo; Johnson, PewDiePie, Richard Branson, and Steve Jobs.\nThey all have their niche but I found that they have some mutual titles which I got interested putting into my reading list:\nRead List  Man\u0026rsquo;s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl (finished as of this writing) Mindset by Dr. Carol Dweck Factfulness by Hans Rosling Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker Measure What Matters by John Doerr Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell Algorithms to Live By by Brian Christian \u0026amp; Tom Griffiths Educated by Tara Westover Zero to One by Peter Thiel  I recommend reading \u0026ldquo;Man\u0026rsquo;s Search for Meaning\u0026rdquo; at least once in your life. 🙂\n Man\u0026rsquo;s Search for Meaning cover\n  Online Courses These are some online video courses like Udemy.

But you can see what I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on rpnradio.com and tunein.rpnradio.com.\nAs for the company\u0026rsquo;s mobile apps - updates are still pending.

Trust me, unless I can\u0026rsquo;t figure it out and need a good night\u0026rsquo;s sleep to come up with a fix.\nLastly, on my very very free time, I can get to play and record playing the guitar and upload to my YouTube channel. Feel free to like or dislike. 🤣 I also compensate some time to stream on Twitch for a few hours.\nI hope these are enough to keep you updated.

I am so longing to be with the family after 6+ months of not going home - I last went home way back December 2020 to spend the holidays.\nI was so looking forward to at least visit a beach, see a sunset, feel the breeze of fresh air but UNLUCKILY the weather ahead was not well! I did not see the predictions that there will be a coming storm for the week. So the first few days were a bust, and I just stayed inside and chilled out with some beer.\nThe 20th was a holiday, and magically the weather was at least fine for us to go to Binmaley beach - don\u0026rsquo;t worry, there were no crowds so we can be safe, I think? The sun was peeping through the clouds and by the afternoon, a mild rain poured. Together with relatives, we spend some time there swimming, singing, EATING, and drinking booze until it\u0026rsquo;s time to go home.\n Binmaley Beach\n   Lumpiang Gulay   My other plans went down the drain as the weather became worse, Dagupan City was flooded (plus high tide) that light vehicles weren\u0026rsquo;t able to pass. Sadly, I can\u0026rsquo;t meet my only city friends. There\u0026rsquo;s still next time right? Right?\nI decided to extend my stay but continued checking some online responsibilities just to make sure they are still up even I\u0026rsquo;m not present in the office - though I failed to join our online meetings.\nWe also went to our grandfather\u0026rsquo;s brother to celebrate his 70th birthday. Then we spent some time (and over pizza) with my cousin to talk about tech and stuff.\n  Selfie with Lolo and Cousin + Damaged Foods 🤣\n  Oh, I also got a haircut (question mark).\n Haircut?\n  That\u0026rsquo;s it for this blog post, thanks for reading!

I will also share my setup how I stream mobile games.\nGrind to Legend Ever since the new season of Call of Duty: Mobile came out, I just wanted to redeem the legendary medal. And also to get all rewards from the Battle Pass I bought. 😂\nDon\u0026rsquo;t worry guys and gals, kuya Red will be back soon. Konti na lang back to Legendary rank na sa BR mode at pwede na mag-Minecraft.\n Locked Legendary Rank\n  Minecraft 1.17 is Here Spigot 1.17 is out and is now available as an option for our server but the plugins are currently unsupported, so we\u0026rsquo;ll stick to 1.16.5. Though I played the snapshots and pre-releases, I am still yet to play Minecraft 1.17 Vanilla.\n\r\rThe caves and cliffs update (part 1) brings new items and features which were detailed on Minecraft\u0026rsquo;s own blog here.\nNow on to my setup.\nMobile Stream Setup Hardware First, let\u0026rsquo;s see the devices I use except for the laptop/PC for streaming.\n iPhone 11 Lightning to AV Digital Adapter HDMI cable Cheap video capture Audio-technica Condenser Mic  I used to play on my Nokia 7 Plus but can\u0026rsquo;t the specs can\u0026rsquo;t keep up, not sure why. This is when I use Vysor, a screen mirroring app that wirelessly share the phone\u0026rsquo;s screen to the PC. Now, that\u0026rsquo;s where the problem is, wireless mirroring makes the sound delayed that playing action games is not a good experience. I invested in both an iPhone and the adapter since I can use them on future projects - software development.\n Lightning to AV Adapter and USB Capture Card\n  I wonder why branded capture cards are so damn expensive?! Like the Elgato HD60S and AverMedia Live Gamer Ultra. So I went ahead and bought a $6 (300 pesos) unbranded USB capture card and it just works fine. Just stick it well on a USB port and it\u0026rsquo;s good to go.\n\rLastly, I recently bought an ATR-2500X condenser mic to record songs and guitars for my YouTube channel. Now it\u0026rsquo;s multi-purpose that I use it on my streams and Zoom meetings.\n Audio-Technica ATR2500X Condenser Mic\n  Software As for the software, I use OBS Studio. I had a bad experience using SLOBS, it freezes and crashes over simple things. I used to do overlays with Streamlabs but then I found StreamElements OBS.Live. It makes things much easier with a direct \u0026ldquo;Go Live\u0026rdquo; button on OBS Studio, chat box, and activity feed. They also provide a nice overlay editor with text-to-speech system on their website.\n StreamElements OBS.Live Plugin\n  Diagram This is how my setup is connected. Remember that you need an internet with at least 4000kbps of upload speed to actually stream your games on Facebook Gaming (source). I stream at 1080p60 with 6000kbps bitrate.\n Hardware Setup Diagram\n  Games List I have a few mobile games on my phone right now compared to my Steam Library. But I own some mobile-worthy games like Stardew Valley and Minecraft: Pocket Edition.\nI have a love and hate relationship with games like PUBG Mobile and Mobile Legends. I am looking forward to Apex Legends: Mobile and Diablo Immortal though. They\u0026rsquo;re both are already in beta preview on Android, currently waiting for the iPhone/iPad version.\nSend me a message to request a game I can play, or we can play together.\nSupport me on Facebook Gaming This seems repetitive, but I do need some support when I go live. It feels like streaming and talking to friends is now an everyday duty, haha. But kidding aside, everyone needs help.\nCheck me here, and let\u0026rsquo;s talk more about tech and things.\n","date":"2021-06-12T04:26:59+08:00","image":"https://reddavid.me/images/feat/codm-fbgg-streaming.png","permalink":"https://reddavid.me/mobile-game-streaming/","title":"Mobile Game Streaming"},{"content":"After more than 3 months of processing Apple Developer Program\u0026rsquo;s requirements, the app is here for iPhones!\nThis is the very same version we release for the Android counterpart read the details on this blog post.

So the first UI update was to change the 4x3 grid to a simple list.\n Station Menu Item Before and After   This subtle change provides the user a hint of \u0026ldquo;click me\u0026rdquo; by giving the list item a design of a button. It also gave a space for the station\u0026rsquo;s detail to be added - station\u0026rsquo;s location and live/offline status.\nHeader and Controls Ok, this area will look crammed especially on small-screen devices. Before this update though, I repositioned the buttons below the controls and were still crammed. This update allowed the horizontal list to be scrolled.\n Header \u0026amp; Controls Before and After   I also changed the text that shows the current stations into a simpler one and updated the share icon.\nNew Font I like Poppins. About Besides the UI updates mentioned above, I added an \u0026ldquo;About\u0026rdquo; page. It is a simple about and external links of RPN.\n About page   Roadmap These are my to-do list for the app, which we will see soon on future updates:\n No internet connection status Bottom player controls (Priority) App-aware sharing Rate and review prompt Links to station email/messaging  Downloads As always, the app is still available for Android and really soon for iOS.\nGoogle Play Store\nHuawei AppGallery\n","date":"2021-05-30T00:15:36+08:00","image":"https://reddavid.me/images/feat/rpnradio-ui.jpeg","permalink":"https://reddavid.me/rpnradio-ui-overhaul/","title":"RPN Radio UI Overhaul"},{"content":"First of all, thank you so much to all who stayed, watched, and enjoyed my content.\nIt was on May 26th that we finally got to a thousand following after a year of starting to be a Gaming Video Creator on Facebook.

The first server I rented became toxic unenjoyable after a few months after opening it into the public - NO it\u0026rsquo;s not because of the new players, but because the server was technically \u0026ldquo;DONE\u0026rdquo; by having usable XP farms, stripped mines, food source, and other auto AFK farms.

I\u0026rsquo;m still a struggling developer and just to let you know, developing for Apple costs more compared to Windows and Google Play Store.\nGet the app below:\n\r\r\r\rLet\u0026rsquo;s Go For the last few weeks, I spent my free time building my app, ZIP Code PH, for iOS using Apple\u0026rsquo;s native language SwiftUI.\nUsing a Mac is not that hard anymore since I\u0026rsquo;ve test ran macOS Catalina on VirtualBox. I managed to run XCode and tried to tinker with the language, and built some UI mockups.\nAnd luckily, the workplace has acquired a mac mini to cater Apple users for our apps (which is coming as soon as possible). I will also be the one developing the iOS apps, so check them out soon.\nDevelopment Main and About Page I am fairly new to SwiftUI so converting? the codes I used for Windows and Xamarin Android app - XAML and C# - will be useless. It took a few days to build the bare UI. I started with the Main Page and the Help page since they don\u0026rsquo;t consume a lot of code-behind.\nThe Main Page took a lot of iterations but below is the final view (as of this writing):\n Main Page\n  The Help/About Page contains the same details I used in the Android app except that I added attributions to the new images in the Main Page (thanks Unsplash!)\nHelp \u0026 About Page\r\r\rSearch Page Next up is the Search Page, I coded this before the menus since the code-behind logic is much simpler since we will use all the zip codes instead of filtering them to areas.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t explorer SwiftUI that much but I found this code to build the Search bar iOS-style:\n iOS Search Bar\n  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45  HStack { TextField(\u0026#34;Search ZIP Code PH\u0026#34;, text: $text) .padding(7) .padding(.horizontal, 25) .background(Color(.systemGray6)) .cornerRadius(8) .overlay( HStack { Image(systemName: \u0026#34;magnifyingglass\u0026#34;) .foregroundColor(.gray) .frame(minWidth: 0, maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .leading) .padding(.leading, 8) if isEditing \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !self.text.isEmpty { Button(action: { self.text = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; }) { Image(systemName: \u0026#34;multiply.circle.fill\u0026#34;) .foregroundColor(.gray) .padding(.trailing, 8) } } } ) .padding(.horizontal, 20) .onTapGesture { self.isEditing = true } if isEditing { Button(action: { print(self.$text) self.isEditing = false self.text = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; // Dismiss the keyboard UIApplication.shared.sendAction(#selector(UIResponder.resignFirstResponder), to: nil, from: nil, for: nil) }) { Text(\u0026#34;Cancel\u0026#34;) } .padding(.leading, -10) .padding(.trailing, 10) .transition(.move(edge: .trailing)) .animation(.easeInOut) } }   \n\rI spent a few times making the search (filtering) logic work the way I wanted that I almost gave up with SwiftUI programming 😅\nMenu and Area List Page After understanding the filtering code while developing the Search Page, it is time to code the Menu and Area pages. The UI looks a lot like the Android counterpart but the built-in Title style for iOS makes the UI better by collapsing the title to inline when scrolled. This is how it looks like on version 1.0.4\n City and Area Pages\n  Favorites Now the challenge begins, how to implement favorites - saving and loading data - while making the UI flexible when an item is added to favorites.\nAfter more than a week of mind-bending development, I made it to work with the help of stackoverflow 😅.

But I knew it was a UI framework from Google which uses a single code-base for mobile and web apps.\nAs you may know now, I developed some apps for Android and iOS using their native languages - Java and SwiftUI - and not a single-codebase language like Flutter. But I did try to code the RPN Radio app using Xamarin.Forms but the implementation of the Audio Players s*cks a$$ to be honest.\nCoding with their native languages was just a personal challenge for me being tech-savvy and wanted to experiment and dive myself to their \u0026ldquo;native world\u0026rdquo;.\nAndroid and Bad (Java) Code The Android Java code stuff was working - well, not that well - the implementation of the player was frequently bugged that it causes the app to crash. I tried several work arounds to the code to prevent the nasties, until I realized this is bad code.\nTo satisfy myself, and the users, I challenged myself to rebuild the app using Flutter.\nEver since March started, I started reading about Flutter and did some basic UI.\nBut first, let me tell you how I installed Flutter on Windows.\nPre-installation (Pre-requisites?)  Make sure you have Git on your device. I installed Git for Windows I\u0026rsquo;ve had Android Studio installed on my system ever since I coded for Android, which is also a recommended IDE for Flutter. Some Android SDKs and; Google Chrome browser.  Installation I pretty much followed the recommended guide as stated here: Install Flutter (Windows). But instead of C:\\src\\flutter, I put it a level higher like this: C:\\flutter.\nThen added environment variable to Path. \u0026lt;- This part is important if you want to run flutter commands in the command line\nRan flutter doctor until all requirements are check out\nIDE, wait\u0026hellip; My IDE of choice is Android Studio, so I can use the emulators I already created and to avoid any additional setup when choosing another.\nUpon opening the IDE, it was said that creating a new Flutter project should be there on the menu screen but it was missing!\nEven though flutter doctor checked everything, I was disappointed that I can\u0026rsquo;t start right away. Scraping the internet for solutions, I checked Android Studio\u0026rsquo;s configuration and there, I downloaded some Flutter and Dart plugins which after a software restart, I can now create a new Flutter project.\n New Flutter Project\n  Since, the app I am planning to rebuild in Flutter is single-paged, it is a good starting-point to play around the Flutter widgets.\nComing from XAML, where everything seems \u0026ldquo;as is\u0026rdquo;, I am so uncomfortable about coding UI using script-like codes. But having started SwiftUI for a few weeks, I pretty much can stand it. 😅\n Flutter UI Code\n  Hello, World Being the beginner, again, I am on my way to building to much more with Flutter with prettier code and nicer implementations.\nI am now reading some books and watching some tutorials on YouTube to help me advance a little more each day.\nEver since February began, I have been active to coding again. Learning new stuff that I do enjoy!\nThanks for reading my blog post, and will share some updates on how I would use Flutter sometime soon! Always take care peeps!\n","date":"2021-03-15T22:06:53+08:00","image":"https://reddavid.me/images/feat/android-love-flutter.png","permalink":"https://reddavid.me/flutter-coding/","title":"Flutter Coding"},{"content":"I updated the tune-in website for RPN. This post will detail the changes, what\u0026rsquo;s new or removed, and how the update went.\nMainPage and Mobile-First Design The main page remains got a few changes, starting with the font face and size. Before the update, the font family forced to check for Proxima Nova and fallback to Arial Nova or other sans serif fonts.\nThen I cleaned up my CSS file to make the whole website \u0026ldquo;mobile-first\u0026rdquo;.  \nNow Playing Station Pages The tune-in or now playing page received most of the update. I\u0026rsquo;ve broken some of them below:\nBack Button The back button got a lot of love with some logic. At first, the button always takes you to the home (main) page with the \u0026lt;a\u0026gt; tag attribute href=\u0026quot;/\u0026quot;.\nNow, it\u0026rsquo;s got a javascript code that checks for an open navigation menu, and whether the history came from the tunein.rpnradio.com domain.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  function goBack() { if (isNavOpen) { closeNav(); } else if (document.referrer == \u0026#34;\u0026#34;) { window.location.href = \u0026#34;https://tunein.rpnradio.com/\u0026#34;; } else { window.history.back(); } }   This logic was finalized when I opened a page link on my iPhone then the back button took me to the previous page - other site.\nNow the back button takes you to home page when started with a station page.\nNavigation Menu The station pages got a navigation menu that resembles the home page. This is to give the listener a continuous audio stream playback whilst needing to change a station.\nNote: The navigation drawer will not work on browser back button - as I learned with other sites. The browser just simply go back to the previous page.\nSecurity The website was also SSL-enabled - HTTPS Everywhere.\nThis also means that the old stream URLs will not work. Thankfully, the audio servers have secured stream URLs for secure websites.\nOpen Graph Metadata Social Media sites are the places where websites get the most referrers. So having metadata for them not just makes the website Facebook- or Twitter-friendly but it is a great addition to how it would look like when shared.\nMaking the images took waaaaay longer than I expected. I decided to add 3 mockup devices that shows the website on these devices. You can see the share preview below:\nFacebook Open Graph Preview\r\rTwitter Open Graph Preview\r\rCreating the metadata tags was made easy by using Metatags.io.\rSite Icons I went on to also update the website\u0026rsquo;s favicons, to differentiate tunein to the news website. It now has the Android app icon below:\n\rWebsite Favicon\r\rGoogle Ads I replaced the part suggesting other methods to tunein (Zeno app, Radio Garden and our native Android app) with a Google Auto ad.\nWe all hate ads but this is the only modest way to profit for most websites.\n.htaccess to Remove .html I finally made it to work, shorten the address for site navigation. Instead of showing the full file name: tunein.rpnradio.com/batac.html Some rules were added to the .htaccess file to make it tunein.rpnradio.com/batac\n.htaccess file:\nRewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]\rRewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} /([^.]+)\\.html [NC]\rRewriteRule ^ /%1 [NC,L,R]\rRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}.html -f\rRewriteRule ^ %{REQUEST_URI}.html [NC,L]\r\rFooter Finally I added a subtle footer to the whole website. That\u0026rsquo;s it. :)\nFinal Words This website is another medium for the company\u0026rsquo;s aim for a greater reach by expanding to Digital Media.

That\u0026rsquo;s what I liked about Apple, the hardware and software work along each other, and like most people, the price-tag for their phones held me back until December.\nI loaned for an iPhone 11 since the iPhone 12 is expensive and I like the 11\u0026rsquo;s grip instead of the sharp edges of the new design.

That we can get through the sh*tty year that is 2020. 🤔 And for last time (and maybe first?), let\u0026rsquo;s take a look back to what happened with Red David\u0026rsquo;s life in last year (SPOILER: not so much, like most of us I guess).\nJanuary Puerto Galera, 2nd week New Year, New Decade! We expected a lot in 2020 coming from 2019. It started out pretty much a normal month. We would have the time to travel out of town,\nIt is always a good feeling when you can travel on the first month of the year, so that\u0026rsquo;s what we did. So my girlfriend and I went to Puerto Galera, Mindoro and rented a place to stay for 3 days and 2 nights.\nThis place has been a must-travel not just for us both but for most of Pinoys. The white sand beach makes this place present on everybody\u0026rsquo;s bucket list.\nOur stay was short but it was worth-while. From walking along the beach, taking \u0026ldquo;artistic\u0026rdquo; photos, watch the sunset enjoyed a quite weekday evening, and chilled during the weekend evening when the \u0026ldquo;bands\u0026rdquo; and music will fill up the place. We also had henna tattoos, got a massage, and just tried to taste all the food.\nHere are some of the photos we took during our short stay:\nTaal Volcano Eruption Ok hold on, this wasn\u0026rsquo;t a part of our trip but as we are leaving the port to return to Metro Manila, we found out that Taal Volcano erupted (which was located in Batangas) but thankfully the eruption was slow that we weren\u0026rsquo;t stranded along the way. But this news may be the start of something awful through 2020.\nThe volcano spewed a lot of volcanic ash that towns and cities, including Metro Manila.\nTrip to BGC, last week This should be the last week of January and the KPop group Winner was doing a tour in Manila. I am not a KPop fan but my sister is that the 3 girls in our family went to SM Mall of Asia to watch them.\n Baclaran Church\n  --\rThe next day, we went to visit Baclaran church to give thanks to the Lord and went straight the infamous Venice Grand Canal Mall in Taguig, a Venice-inspired open-air mall.\n Venice Grand Canal Mall in Taguig\n  After exhausting the whole place, we went down to Bonifacio High Grounds which is not that far from the canal mall. We just walked around the place, took some photos, and tried to visit a museum but unfortunately they were already closed.\n\rFebruary Valentine\u0026rsquo;s Day and a New Laptop Hmmm, nothing much happened this month, just the usual Valentine\u0026rsquo;s date on the 14th. We just went to this semi-high end restaurant and ordered some pizza, pasta, and wine.\nI also got a new laptop, my third Acer laptop - been an Acer user since 2011-ish because of it\u0026rsquo;s ok specs at a lower price. I blogged about that laptop here: I Got Myself a New Laptop\n\rMarch Oh no! Oh how it started so well until a new unknown deadly virus broke out of Wuhan, China.\nIt seemed the world has stopped due to lockdowns, and despite the technological advancement we have since the last decade, we still took too long for a cure.\nThese, I think, are the times we don\u0026rsquo;t want to talk about anymore.\n\rApril - November I\u0026rsquo;ll sumamrize these months here, since we all have been in lock down and stayed in our homes. But luckily for us, our occupation allowed us to still make a living and let us stay in.\nWithin these months, the government has been extending and extending the quarantine every 30 days - they just fear for public panic if they announce a definite lockdown for a year.\nI went busy during these time, did some web and app development, went on to stream some games on Facebook Gaming and took some online courses (view my LinkedIn profile here).\nWith all of these, I upgraded (again) my peripherals for my convenience (sorry Girlfried, 😂). I bought a over-the-head headset and an earbuds, for better Zoom meetings and streaming - the JBL Quantum 200 and the HyperX Cloud earbuds. I also got myself a wireless Logitech gaming mouse, the G304, which I reviewed here and a Tecware mechanical keyboard TKL, which you can read more about here.\n JBL Quantum 200 (pardon the mess)\n   Logitech G304\n   Tecware Elite TKL\n  I also went on to upgrade my work PC\u0026rsquo;s SSD for a better brand and higher storage, cheaper though - the XPG 8200. Also bought a JBL Go3 bluetooth speaker, and the Logitech C922 webcam, also for Zoom meetings 🤣. I blogged about the camera here: Finally! Logitech C922\n Logitech C922\n  \rDecember Christmas and New Year\u0026rsquo;s Eve This might be the hardest Christmas and New Year we\u0026rsquo;ve all faced and celebrated, but lucky enough, I had the chance to take a break from the rat race and went home to celebrate the holidays with the family together with my father whom was also stuck in his workplace city due to quarantine and lockdown.\nThe shopping continues, I got myself the Razer Hammerhead Wireless earbuds and a yellow iPhone 11 for Christmas. I did not post a blog about the wireless earbuds since the unit I got was faulty (had it replaced now). And I prefer not to flaunt my new iPhone since there\u0026rsquo;s nothing special about it, my ultimate goal of buying one is to develop apps for iOS.\n Razer BT Earbuds and Yellow iPhone 11\n  \rHow\u0026rsquo;s Your 2020? This year had been a mix of emotions but mostly depressing. We still coping to the new normal, keeping safe, and I know we all miss socializing.\nThis might look like a tech shopping spree for me but I also grew my Facebook page from 261 to 940 this year. Played and streamed some good games - MINECRAFT!\nRead a few books, got certificates from online courses, and especially I am still alive and healthy.\nHow did your 2020 go?

I finally got the C922 PRO HD Webcam from Logitech after wishing having it for years.\nHonestly, I bought the camera in a slightly higher price due to the model being out of stock in major stores and just got from a \u0026ldquo;hoarder\u0026rdquo; in Facebook marketplace. :) Harsh but true.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get into my short blog/review/impression about this industry-standard in semi-professional streaming.\nYou might ask, why only now? At first, I never really thought of having a good webcam as a small streamer, and I also have this app on my Android phone which makes my Nokia 7 Plus act as a webcam. Then, I wanted the camera to be positioned well, so I bought a cheaper Logitech, the C270.\n Logitech C270 webcam\n  The C270 suited my needs - stream just now and then, and it\u0026rsquo;s just right for video calls and conferencing. The only problem with this one is it has a bad exposure. I used the C270 for almost 3 months until I got the money to buy the beast of a camera, that is the C922.\nThe Box I opened a brand new Logitech C922 way way before but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t mine, so I already know the contents (alibi for not having pictures after unboxing 😂). And I also tried the unit itself so I knew the quality it brings.\nThe box contains the C922 camera, a table-top tripod, manuals and a sheet containing the free 3-month XSplit Premium codes (Again, sorry for not having pictures).\n Logitech C922 Box\n  Quick specs I won\u0026rsquo;t dive deep into the webcam\u0026rsquo;s specifications like weight and dimensions but here are the common \u0026ldquo;marketing\u0026rdquo; specs that will actually make you consider buying one:\n Capture 1080p @ 30fps, or 720p @ 60fps Auto focus Wide Field of View Advanced camera software  Ha! Mountable The C922 has a screw hole for mounting onto a tripod. The tripod can be extended up to 18.5cm. Here\u0026rsquo;s the closed tripod in three max lengths (with regards to the feet extensions).\nLogitech C922 Tripod Screw Hole and Lengths\r\rThe tripod, without and with the webcam.\nLogitech C922 Tripod\r\r\rThe C922 also has a built-in microphone but most people, including me, advice to use an external mic instead.\nSoftware - Logitech Capture Upon connecting the webcam to my PC, Logitech prompted to install the companion software - Logitech Capture. The software is advanced enough for my needs - I can zoom and pan, flip the captured video horizontally and/or vertically, choose to prefer exposure or framerate, and most importantly the capture resolutions.\n Logitech Capture Software\n  Resolutions The software provides templates for typical sizes:\nWidescreen:\n FHD (1080p), 720p, and 360p;  Portrait:\n 1080x1920, 720x1280, and 360x640;  Squares:\n 1080x1080, 720x720, and 360x360.   Resolution Options\n  PiP and Layers The software also allows us to output custom layout.\nEffects The software also allows you to add effects, text, etc with the Effects menu: Watermark, Text Overlay, Scene effects, Color borders, and Transitions for 2 scenes.\n Effects Options\n  \rMinor Issues There are a couple of issues for me, the first one really makes me annoyed is that I cannot turn off the hotkeys for the software and I have a frameless monitor which mounting the camera is a pain in the a$$ to keep it from covering up the display - even for just a centimeter.\n Logitech C922 Frameless Monitor\n  Great Overall Overall, I am happy with the C922 webcam - my loved ones can see me clearly during video calls. And I thank everybody for supporting me on my stream, visiting my website, and checking my Windows 10 apps.\n Logitech C922 Monitor-Mounted with Logitech Capture\n  To finish this blog post, let\u0026rsquo;s all stay safe during the pandemic - and even after the pandemic.\n","date":"2020-10-01T23:17:51+08:00","image":"https://reddavid.me/images/feat/logitech-c922.jpg","permalink":"https://reddavid.me/the-logitech-c922/","title":"Finally! Logitech C922"},{"content":"Foreword This is a simple review and unboxing post for my newly bought keyboard today. It is the Tecware Phantom Elite TKL with Gateron brown switches. I am using it to write this post.\nI have used a number of mechanical keyboards in the past, the first one was an Aula one with Outemu blues. Then a TKL with blue Gateron switches, I forgot the brand, but it\u0026rsquo;s also Chinese. And my slightly premium keyboards, the Logitech G403 and the G810.\nThe G810 was a stay-at-home keyboard for my laptop and the G403 lives in the office. And guess what, both are defective with unresponsive and ghosting keys, respectively. I thought of delaying buying a new one for \u0026ldquo;budget\u0026rdquo; reasons but coding with keyboard issues is a definitely a pain in the ass with constant deleting doubling keys and characters. I am looking for several \u0026ldquo;budget\u0026rdquo; keyboards out there, including the TNC Icarus one with Cherry MXs but the delivery time was so bad that I had to settle down with this one.\nComing from Logitech, I almost passed on this one for its \u0026ldquo;gamer\u0026rdquo; font which I don\u0026rsquo;t think is clean for my desk, but my wallet said \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s okay, you can live with that\u0026rdquo;.\nI bought one with brown switches since the old ones I had had Romer-Gs with a \u0026ldquo;mushy-tactile\u0026rdquo; feel on keypress so I don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry much about them on the long run.\nUnboxing The box looks premium with minimal print of the logo and keyboard model on the center.\n Tecware Phantom TKL box\n  Inside the box was the keyboard wrapped in plastic. It also came with 4 extra switches and a switch puller.\n Tecware Phantom unbox\n   Extra switches with puller\n  TKL The keyboard has a TKL layout, with software-customizable RGB setting, and replaceable switches (modular). It costs php2,500, slightly costier than their Tecware Phantoms - I\u0026rsquo;m yet to investigate why.\n Tecware RGB software\n  About the \u0026ldquo;gamer\u0026rdquo; font I hated, this game with a cleaner font. Surprised am I! Though the printing of the keycaps has the \u0026ldquo;stencil\u0026rdquo; cut beneath that the LED does not shine that much. Guess I\u0026rsquo;m okay after all. Some function keys, has this cheap white printing that I fear them to get scraped off some time soon.\n The keyboard itself\n  RGB The RGB lighting is good with bunch of built-in modes which can be visualized and edited using their software. Here\u0026rsquo;s what it looks like in an unlit office desk.\n RGB lighting in unlit room\n  I went ahead for a typing test and got a 76wpm results with no mistyped words. But let\u0026rsquo;s see how long this budget badboy keyboard lasts.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all, just a short review and unboxing post for the internet people to see. If you want me to have a typing test and sound test for it, let me know.\nSupport Me Also, my apps are still available in the Microsoft Store and some in the Google Play Store, where I mostly get my funds for buying these stuff.

I ordered it online from DataBlitz for $39, and was delivered quickly in 2 days.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s in the box? The box contains the wireless mouse itself, the usual manuals, Logitech Gaming promo leaflet, a blue G logo sticker, a Duracell AA battery, and a USB extension cord.\n Box contents\n  Let\u0026rsquo;s get Physical! Battery compartment The mouse has no RGB strip like it\u0026rsquo;s cousins (G Pro/G203) but it has a single RGB LED that indicates colored DPI assignments in Logitech G Hub. The battery compartment and the USB receiver is accessed through the lower top part of the mouse - by sliding it off the body.\n Logitech G304\n  Battery included I currently use an Energizer Lithium AA battery which I believe is lighter but I still keep the free battery whenever I need a heavier setup.\n AA Batteries (front came with the product)\n  Bottom Switch The power switch is located below the mouse with a red and blue color indicator for off and on state. The bottom also has an extra slide compared to the G Pro/G203.\n Bottom view of grip\n  Grip The mouse shape fits perfectly in my hands and I can switch to the wired G Pro when I play some competitive games - not that this can\u0026rsquo;t do the job. But I often stick to this, G304, every time I stream my games (shameless plug - https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG/)\n Top view grip\n   Side view of grip\n  Reliability I used this since day one - June 2 - and I only got a hiccup once during a Dota 2 game which made me switch to wired, and since then I used this as a daily driver and on my games. Lately, I am playing Minecraft a lot, some Dota 2, CS:GO, some Valorant, Metro Exodus, just finished Mafia II: Definitive Edition, C\u0026amp;C Yuri\u0026rsquo;s Revenge.\nVerdict My overall experience using the same shape of a mouse will be just comfortable throughout my day - office job and being a small-time streamer. It also frees your hand positions by not limited by a wired mouse. Despite it not having an RGB, I would suggest this for small-handed people, for those who travel a lot and for gamers and streamers looking for a budget wireless gaming mouse.\nMore info?

As an ECE, I knew that some percentage of any electronics produced out there do have flaws - and this is not an excuse for their price - but in the \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; world, these things can happen. Also, when looking at r/mechanicalkeyboards they combo their awesome keebs with a Logitech mouse despite them hating on Romer-G\u0026rsquo;s.\nThis is my \u0026ldquo;short\u0026rdquo; history on my Logitech mouse shopping and usage. Here it goes:\nG302 If I recall correctly, my first mouse from Logitech was the G302, it has the odd shape but it just fits nicely in my hand. I used it for almost 2 years until it went \u0026ldquo;double-clicking\u0026rdquo; due to playing Dota 2. I just scavenged some old A4tech mouse and took out the switches (Huanos?) to replace one on the G302. The G302 still works today but it has this rattling noise due to the broken plastics inside.\n G302 still works this day\n  G203 Then I bought a G203, a smaller mouse sporting with the new logo. I bought this to have an RGB mouse. This is when I started to jump on the \u0026ldquo;Logitech mouse hype\u0026rdquo;.\n My G203 with brand new HyperX Fury mouse mat\n  Impulse Buying the G403 Being on the \u0026ldquo;hype train\u0026rdquo;, I impulse bought a G403 when it became available in my country despite my current G203 still works. The G403 was not comfortable for my hand - well, the shops before don\u0026rsquo;t have demo units - so I bought another G203 as I gave the old one to my GF for office use. The G403 is stored for now.\n Impulse bought G403 😂\n  After some time, GF\u0026rsquo;s workplace decided to renovate so I took the G203 back and decided to \u0026ldquo;mod\u0026rdquo; it and cut the wire too short making it unroutable to my home setup. This older G203 is now in my \u0026ldquo;junk box\u0026rdquo;.\nGPro on Discount I think all through the year 2019, I was looking to buy their wireless mouse - the G304. It has the same shape as the G203 and has the new HERO sensor. And that one time when I decided to finally buy one, I first asked a salesperson if there were any Logitech promos and I was told that the G Pro was 50% off. Without hesitation, I bought it instead of the G304.\n Half-priced G Pro, not a bad buy\n  The G Pro is physically the same as G203 but has a braided cable, stiffer mouse wheel, and sporting the PMW3366 optical gaming sensor. I use this in the office with a cheap mouse bungee to keep the wire neat.\nG304 Wireless Fast forward March 2020, city-wide was on lockdown, knowing that I would be staying in the office for quite some time, I lend my laptop to my GF for her to use. I also lend her the (working) G203.\nAfter some time staying in the office, I decided to neat up my desk and I found it a hassle for wires (with dual monitors, keyboards, USB cords, and whatnot) so I thought, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s time to check that G304 I wished for the longest time. And there\u0026rsquo;s a sale incoming too.\u0026rdquo;\n 28-day old G304\n  I checked Lazada but I was skeptical to buy electronics from them – to avoid the hassle process of returning a defective product. This is when I learned that my \u0026ldquo;favorite\u0026rdquo; gaming store I bought my previous Logitech mice has a \u0026ldquo;better\u0026rdquo; website and I checked the G304 and it was cheaper compared to its store retail price. I bought it as a gift for myself this June.\nHere on my desk right now is the G304 and the G Pro. I use the G304 for daily work and casual games and the G Pro for FPS and competitive gaming. I will be posting my review for the G304 soon. And sorry for the lack of better pictures of my mice.\n","date":"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z","image":"https://reddavid.me/images/07-20/logi-hero.png","permalink":"https://reddavid.me/story-of-owning-logitech-mice/","title":"Story of my Logitech Mice"},{"content":"When the sudden rise of Covid-19 cases here in the Philippines, the government was urged to implement a community quarantine - which was a lockdown - public transportation is suspended, non-essential businesses must be closed or simply everyone should stay at home.\nBut working on a media and broadcasting field, yet being the transmitter engineers, we can\u0026rsquo;t help but think: Uhm, how about us?\nUnfortunately, it took almost 2 days to formulize measures for us; don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, we wanted to be safe, but being the essential skeletal personnel in the operations of news source, and in my own opinion, we had to keep the broadcast on-air.\nTo reduce public exposure, we were assigned a 7-day work-week and 7-day home-rest during the quarantine imposed by the government.

God help us.\nThere is also this viral in social media right now comparing, lest, swapping their local Mayors for not acting amidst the pandemic. It makes me laugh but at times like these, it can be a serious matter where we should learn not to vote the incompetent leaders.\nWe still don\u0026rsquo;t know how will this affect our monetary status. But we are pretty sure our savings will be affected. If you can, you can help me stay safe and secure at home:\nDonate maybe? 🙂 Thank you.\nSmall help for your boy\n","date":"2020-03-19T01:28:20+08:00","image":"https://reddavid.me/images/at-home.jpg","permalink":"https://reddavid.me/staying-at-home-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/","title":"Staying at Home During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"content":"It was early 2019, I think when I accidentally deleted my WordPress database that contains at least 20 posts. Sad right? After that sad moment, I tried to repost everything using Hugo, a static website builder, but found that it was too complicated - with YAML, some .scss, layouts, etc.\nSo I gave up and made a basic website with just HTML, CSS, and JS files. It was ok for me, just having a landing page for my apps, other works and a short bio.\nUntil I do wanted to do some blog, not that daily blog but just somewhere to share my thoughts. So here we are again, I would actually give time to understand Hugo and what not. Welcome me again!\n","date":"2020-02-23T21:43:46+08:00","image":"https://reddavid.me/images/hugo.png","permalink":"https://reddavid.me/rebuilding-website-with-hugo/","title":"Rebuilding Website with Hugo"},{"content":"Foreword Last February 15, I got myself a new Acer laptop. It is an Acer Nitro 5 laptop sporting an AMD Ryzen 3550H with RX560X Graphics. This makes my 3rd Acer laptop in a span of 8+ years and my first ever AMD on a laptop (had an AMD Athlon X2 PC before).\nThis laptop costs Php34,999 and we could not find a promo since every store follows the retail price. Although, the laptop was on promo with having an included a single stick of 8GB DDR4 memory (upgraded from 4GB), 128GB SSD (m.2 SATA) and a 1TB mechanical drive (not SSHD).\nThe laptop includes a generic-looking backpack - yes, I said generic since I saw somewhere that there is a gaming-accented version of the bag.\nQuick Specs:  AMD Ryzen 5 3550H Quad-Core with Vega 8 Graphics (which consumes 2GB of RAM) AMD Radeon RX560X 4GB DDR4 - Here\u0026rsquo;s the catch, upon checking CPU-Z the - installed memory stick is rated at 2666MHz but later found out that Ryzen 3550H is limited to 2400MHz, so maybe that is a bummer 15.6\u0026quot; FHD 1920x1080p IPS LCD(slim-frame), Red Backlit-keyboard Dual M.2 (nVME only + SATA only) + 1 HDD slots  Full specs of the laptop can be found here\n\rUsing the laptop Speed Coming from an Intel i7 laptop, I felt the difference in boot up times, booting on this device is slightly slower - not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s because of the SSD installed, since I was using a Samsung 860 Evo on my old laptop.\nNext is using Visual Studio, rebuilding some of my apps takes a longer time to finish. Also, having only 6GB of memory (since the 2GB is shared for AMD switchable graphics) I can\u0026rsquo;t stand having my chrome tabs reload after a while.\nGaming Before my old laptop broke (which was an Acer Nitro V, with an Intel i7 4th gen + 2GB GTX960M), I was just playing some Minecraft (sometimes with Shaders), some casual Dota 2, and other medium-intensive games.\nOf course, I was playing either inside an aircon-ed room or the fan pointing to the laptop.\nMeanwhile on this new laptop, launching games, even Dota 2, was a pain. It took too long that sometimes it would just not respond and fails to load at all.\nBut before even buying this, I said to myself that I can\u0026rsquo;t game like I did before - long hours, intensive AAA games - so I disregarded this experience, at first.\nOverall (System) Experience Out of habit, I installed the latest drivers including Radeon software (Adrenaline 2020). But the app is laggy as hell and eventually gave me a black screen out of nowhere - which I made a hard boot just to go back seeing things to Windows.\nUpon checking, it installed an older driver. (Damn AMD)\nEven though I use an external mech keyboard, this keyboard layout is hideous compared to the old Nitro V I had! I am missing the Pause/Break key but I believe it is hidden in F11, I believe.\nThe ports are ok, but the Type-C is not thunderbolt. The power port is on the middle of the body!!!\nNitro Sense is a great addition that it lets you control the laptop fans manually - they can get loud man! The fan layout is not \u0026ldquo;optimal\u0026rdquo; in my opinion though.\nLastly, the speakers on it are s**t 🤮. Apparently this is what we get for this price. 🤷🏽\n\rUpgrades It took me two weeks to \u0026ldquo;settle\u0026rdquo; with this new laptop and sometimes got me thinking of \u0026ldquo;regrets\u0026rdquo;. But I actually planned to upgrade memory - I just didn\u0026rsquo;t have the money 😂.\nI got an 8GB TeamGroup stick 2666MHz despite the CPU limit since I can re-use them (on future units or resell them), and the price difference to a 2400MHz is minimal.\nThe unit has not easy-access so I went to a service center to install the RAM together with my old WD 500GB SSD just to have an \u0026ldquo;extra\u0026rdquo; faster storage. The service was free, and it took only 30 minutes because of some papers to fill-out but the service was fast.\nThe unit was faster, and launching apps and games was indeed faster. I also got extra fps in games, saved seconds to minutes in Visual Studio, and Chrome tabs are saved.\nThe only problem here now is having an older, OEM-issued drivers for the graphics card.\nReplaying some games with higher FPS is also a plus.\nRight now, I am thinking of upgrading to nVMe, to a higher 2.5\u0026quot; SSD and 32GB RAM 😳.\n\rOther notes Catch me play a game on this device in Facebook Gaming. Support my tech lust by buying me a coffee or send a tip for my next upgrade\nThank you\n","date":"2020-02-18T16:30:40+08:00","image":"https://reddavid.me/images/feat/acer-laptop.jpg","permalink":"https://reddavid.me/new-laptop/","title":"I Got Myself a New Laptop"},{"content":"Hey hey, recently I branched out my C# and apps knowledge to create and actually port or make versions of my UWP apps to Android using Xamarin Forms.\nFinally opt-in and registered to Google Play platform and chose RPN News \u0026amp; Radio to the Store as the first app (under my registered dev name) to become publicly available.\nObviously, this is unofficial and not backed by my employers.
