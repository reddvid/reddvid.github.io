<h1 style="text-align: center;">About Me</h1>


Hi! I am David. I am an electronics engineer and a software programmer.

I work in broadcast field since 2014. I code and develop apps on my rest days.

I manage and admin website and other digital media (e.g. live stream, social media, cPanel).

I am also an experienced object-oriented programming using C#. I also happen to know XAML, SQL, and Git. I use Visual Studio, VS Code, and Illustrator/Figma to design app logos, UI mockups, and promo images.


## Background
I started coding in college for our project study, RFID Gate System. We used VB.Net for the software and C++ for the Arduino microprocessor. After that, I got started in Windows Phone App development and learned C#, XAML, and Git. The first apps I created were mostly for personal-use until I registered and submitted one to the Windows Store.

Then I started coding apps which helped me simplify the jobs I do - from monitoring and reporting data and statistics to automating web interactions. What started as a hobby became a small source of income. I have more than a dozen apps available right now in the Windows 10 Store.

And right now, I am learning web development and looking forward to get a Microsoft Certification.

## Bio
Born and raised in a small town in Pangasinan, Philippines on 14th of June, 1992.

I can speak Filipino (Tagalog), and English (spoken: 8, written: 9). I can also speak in my local dialect, Pangasinan.

I took up Electronics Engineering as my bachelor's degree in 2008 from Colegio de Dagupan. Where among engineering subjects, there were those which tackled: Turbo C/C++, Arduino, HTML and web, and Java. There were projects that also needed coding: LED Matrix using Great Cow BASIC.

I graduated and passed the Electronics Engineering board exams in 2013.
