            </div><h1 id="update">Update</h1>
<p>The app is now available for iPhones. See the <a href="#download-here">download section</a> below.</p>
<hr >
<p>It&rsquo;s been a while again since my last post but there were no significant updates lately - besides another week-long vacation. So let me introduce this new mobile app from RPN that I developed and releasing now.</p>
<h1 id="delays">Delays</h1>
<p>The app had a working beta for Android devices for awhile now with bare experience and a better update has been in the works. I took the time to work out the database functions, UI and UX, and some other features (mobile ads, and customized links).</p>
<p>I apologize for the delay but I just made sure these features are working for production.</p>
<h1 id="app-details">App Details</h1>
<p>Most brands nowadays accompany their line of business with a mobile app, beside the <a href="https://tunein.rpnradio.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RPN Radio app</a> which was released so much earlier, I am now finally be able to bring news mobile app for Android devices, and iPhones.</p>
<p>Right now, the app is a feed for the provincial news as visible on <a href="https://rpnradio.com/category/provincial-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RPN website</a>. The news are gathered by our provincial/regional news stations that you can read from the website or from the app - for much easier reading and sharing.</p>
<h1 id="screenshots">Screenshots</h1>
<p>It took too long to release the app that the version is now at 2.1. Below are screenshots (store previews for iPhone and Android).</p>

    <title>RPN Radio UI Overhaul</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/rpnradio-ui-overhaul/</link>
    <pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 00:15:36 &#43;0800</pubDate><dc:creator>David</dc:creator><guid>https://reddavid.me/rpnradio-ui-overhaul/</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/feat/rpnradio-ui.jpeg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>Browsing Instagram on my account now floods me with several UI/UX tips and practices, making me inspired to update and retouch my apps with some latest trends in mobile designs.</p>
<h1 id="old-look">Old Look</h1>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at what the app looked like before the update:</p>
<figure class="image">


<figcaption><em>Old UI</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>Though it looked intuitive - with just two simple steps: 1) Launch app, 2) Select station and Listen; the main page does not give the user context on what the app does, which raise this question:</p>
<p><strong><em>What am I supposed to do?</em></strong></p>
<h2 id="menu-list">Menu List</h2>
<p>At first glance of a first-time user, the stations list does NOT show that it is &ldquo;clickable&rdquo;. So the first UI update was to change the 4x3 grid to a simple list.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Station Menu Item Before and After</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>This subtle change provides the user a hint of &ldquo;click me&rdquo; by giving the list item a design of a button. It also gave a space for the station&rsquo;s detail to be added - station&rsquo;s location and live/offline status.</p>
<h2 id="header-and-controls">Header and Controls</h2>
<p>Ok, this area will look crammed especially on small-screen devices. Before this update though, I repositioned the buttons below the controls and were still crammed. This update allowed the horizontal list to be scrolled.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Header & Controls Before and After</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>I also changed the text that shows the current stations into a simpler one and updated the share icon.</p>
<h2 id="new-font">New Font</h2>
<p>I like <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Poppins</a>.
<br></p>
<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>Besides the UI updates mentioned above, I added an &ldquo;About&rdquo; page. It is a simple about and external links of RPN.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>About page</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<h1 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h1>
<p>These are my to-do list for the app, which we will see soon on future updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>No internet connection status</li>
<li>Bottom player controls (Priority)</li>
<li>App-aware sharing</li>
<li>Rate and review prompt</li>
<li>Links to station email/messaging</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="downloads">Downloads</h1>
<p>As always, the app is still available for Android and (REALLY) soon for iOS.</p>
<p>Google Play Store: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rpnradio.radiov1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rpnradio.radiov1</a></p>

            </div><p>Now that ZIP Code PH is available for both Android and iOS, I wanted to build a landing page for it.</p>
<h1 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h1>
<p>I viewed some designs online and found inspiration from <a href="https://get-thrive.app/" target="_blank">Thrive</a>, which I never heard of - thanks anyway!</p>
<h1 id="launch-and-land">Launch and Land</h1>
<p>The webpage is available <a href="https://reddavid.me/zipcodeph-app" target="_blank">HERE</a>. The page is still a link to my website but will soon acquire a domain for it soon. Also, the page is still a basic design but complete with the download links, which I will improve soon.</p>
<p>Will keep you updated!</p>

    <title>[Update: NOW AVAILABLE] ZIP Code PH for iOS</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/zipcodeph-ios/</link>
    <pubDate>Tue, 16 Mar 2021 01:28:15 &#43;0800</pubDate><dc:creator>David</dc:creator><guid>https://reddavid.me/zipcodeph-ios/</guid>

            </div><h1 id="update-now-available">Update: Now Available</h1>
<p>You can get the app from App Store (iPhone and iPad) for only Php49 (US$0.99) - sorry for the paywall. I&rsquo;m still a struggling developer and just to let you know, developing for Apple costs more compared to Windows and Google Play Store.</p>
<p>Get the app below: <br/>
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zip-code-ph/id1555921863?itsct=apps_box&amp;itscg=30200" style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; border-radius: 13px; width: 250px; height: 83px;"></a></p>
<hr/>
<h1 id="lets-go">Let&rsquo;s Go</h1>
<p>For the last few weeks, I spent my free time building my app, ZIP Code PH, for iOS using Apple&rsquo;s native language SwiftUI.</p>
<p>Using a Mac is not that hard anymore since I&rsquo;ve test ran macOS Catalina on VirtualBox. I managed to run XCode and tried to tinker with the language, and built some UI mockups.</p>
<p>And luckily, the workplace has acquired a mac mini to cater Apple users for our apps (which is coming as soon as possible). I will also be the one developing the iOS apps, so check them out soon.</p>
<h1 id="development">Development</h1>
<h2 id="main-and-about-page">Main and About Page</h2>
<p>I am fairly new to SwiftUI so converting? the codes I used for Windows and Xamarin Android app - XAML and C# - will be useless. It took a few days to build the bare UI. I started with the Main Page and the Help page since they don&rsquo;t consume a lot of code-behind.</p>
<p>The Main Page took a lot of iterations but below is the final view (as of this writing):</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Main Page</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>The Help/About Page contains the same details I used in the Android app except that I added attributions to the new images in the Main Page (thanks <a href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_blank">Unsplash!</a>)</p>
<figure class="image">


<figcaption><em>Help & About Page</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<h2 id="search-page">Search Page</h2>
<p>Next up is the Search Page, I coded this before the menus since the code-behind logic is much simpler since we will use all the zip codes instead of filtering them to areas.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t explorer SwiftUI that much but I found this code to build the Search bar iOS-style:</p>

<p>I spent a few times making the search (filtering) logic work the way I wanted that I almost gave up with SwiftUI programming 😅</p>
<h2 id="menu-and-area-list-page">Menu and Area List Page</h2>
<p>After understanding the filtering code while developing the Search Page, it is time to code the Menu and Area pages. The UI looks a lot like the Android counterpart but the built-in Title style for iOS makes the UI better by collapsing the title to inline when scrolled. This is how it looks like on version 1.0.4</p>

<h2 id="favorites">Favorites</h2>
<p>Now the challenge begins, how to implement favorites - saving and loading data - while making the UI flexible when an item is added to favorites.</p>
<p>After more than a week of mind-bending development, I made it to work with the help of stackoverflow 😅. (Every developer use it, right? Right?)</p>

    <title>Flutter Coding</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/flutter-coding/</link>
    <pubDate>Mon, 15 Mar 2021 22:06:53 &#43;0800</pubDate><dc:creator>David</dc:creator><guid>https://reddavid.me/flutter-coding/</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/feat/android-love-flutter.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>I&rsquo;ve heard about Flutter a long time ago but never actually used it or read in-depth about it. But I knew it was a UI framework from Google which uses a single code-base for mobile and web apps.</p>
<p>As you may know now, I developed some apps for Android and iOS using their native languages - Java and SwiftUI - and not a single-codebase language like Flutter. But I did try to code the RPN Radio app using Xamarin.Forms but the implementation of the Audio Players s*cks a$$ to be honest.</p>
<p>Coding with their native languages was just a personal challenge for me being tech-savvy and wanted to experiment and dive myself to their &ldquo;native world&rdquo;.</p>
<h1 id="android-and-bad-java-code">Android and Bad (Java) Code</h1>
<p>The Android Java code stuff was working - well, not that well - the implementation of the player was frequently bugged that it causes the app to crash. I tried several work arounds to the code to prevent the nasties, until I realized this is bad code.</p>
<p>To satisfy myself, and the users, I challenged myself to rebuild the app using Flutter.</p>
<p>Ever since March started, I started reading about Flutter and did some basic UI.</p>
<p>But first, let me tell you how I installed Flutter on Windows.</p>
<h1 id="pre-installation-pre-requisites">Pre-installation (Pre-requisites?)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have Git on your device. I installed Git for Windows</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve had Android Studio installed on my system ever since I coded for Android, which is also a recommended IDE for Flutter.</li>
<li>Some Android SDKs and;</li>
<li>Google Chrome browser.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<p>I pretty much followed the recommended guide as stated here: <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Install Flutter (Windows)</a>. But instead of <code>C:\src\flutter</code>, I put it a level higher like this: <code>C:\flutter</code>.</p>
<p>Then added environment variable to Path. &lt;- This part is important if you want to run flutter commands in the command line</p>
<p>Ran <code>flutter doctor</code> until all requirements are check out</p>
<h1 id="ide-wait">IDE, wait&hellip;</h1>
<p>My IDE of choice is Android Studio, so I can use the emulators I already created and to avoid any additional setup when choosing another.</p>
<p>Upon opening the IDE, it was said that creating a new Flutter project should be there on the menu screen but it was missing!</p>
<p>Even though <code>flutter doctor</code> checked everything, I was disappointed that I can&rsquo;t start right away. Scraping the internet for solutions, I checked Android Studio&rsquo;s configuration and there, I downloaded some Flutter and Dart plugins which after a software restart, I can now create a new Flutter project.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>New Flutter Project</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>Since, the app I am planning to rebuild in Flutter is single-paged, it is a good starting-point to play around the Flutter widgets.</p>
<p>Coming from XAML, where everything seems &ldquo;as is&rdquo;, I am so uncomfortable about coding UI using script-like codes. But having started SwiftUI for a few weeks, I pretty much can stand it. 😅</p>
<figure class="image">

</figure>
<br/>
<h1 id="beginning">Beginning</h1>
<p>Being the beginner, again, I am on my way to building to much more with Flutter with prettier code and nicer implementations.</p>
<p>I am now reading some books and watching some tutorials on YouTube to help me advance a little more each day.</p>
<p>Ever since February began, I have been active to coding again. Learning new stuff that I do enjoy!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading my blog post, and will share some updates on how I would use Flutter sometime soon! Always take care peeps!</p>

    <title>Tune In RPN Radio Update</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/tunein-update/</link>
    <pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2021 20:30:09 &#43;0800</pubDate><dc:creator>David</dc:creator><guid>https://reddavid.me/tunein-update/</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/feat/rpn-tunein.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>I updated the tune-in website for RPN. This post will detail the changes, what&rsquo;s new or removed, and how the update went.</p>
<h1 id="mainpage-and-mobile-first-design">MainPage and Mobile-First Design</h1>
<p>The main page remains got a few changes, starting with the font face and size. Before the update, the font family forced to check for <a href="https://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/proxima-nova" target="_blank">Proxima Nova</a> and fallback to Arial Nova or other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif" target="_blank">sans serif fonts.</a></p>
<p>Then I cleaned up my CSS file to make the whole website <a href="https://medium.com/@Vincentxia77/what-is-mobile-first-design-why-its-important-how-to-make-it-7d3cf2e29d00" target="_blank">&ldquo;mobile-first&rdquo;.</a>
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="now-playing-station-pages">Now Playing Station Pages</h1>
<p>The tune-in or now playing page received most of the update. I&rsquo;ve broken some of them below:</p>
<h2 id="back-button">Back Button</h2>
<p>The back button got a lot of love with some logic. At first, the button always takes you to the home (main) page with the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag attribute <code>href=&quot;/&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s got a javascript code that checks for an open navigation menu, and whether the history came from the tunein.rpnradio.com domain.</p>
<pre><code>function goBack() {
  if (isNavOpen) {
    closeNav();
  }
  else if (document.referrer == "") {
    window.location.href = "https://tunein.rpnradio.com/";
  }
  else {
    window.history.back();
  }
}; </code></pre>
<p>This logic was finalized when I opened a page link on my iPhone then the back button took me to the previous page - other site.</p>
<p>Now the back button takes you to home page when started with a station page.</p>
<h2 id="navigation-menu">Navigation Menu</h2>
<p>The station pages got a navigation menu that resembles the home page. This is to give the listener a continuous audio stream playback whilst needing to change a station.</p>
<p>Note: The navigation drawer will not work on browser back button - as I learned with other sites. The browser just simply go back to the previous page.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="security">Security</h1>
<p>The website was also SSL-enabled - <a href="https://www.websecurity.digicert.com/security-topics/https-everywhere" target="_blank">HTTPS Everywhere.</a></p>
<p>This also means that the old stream URLs will not work. Thankfully, the audio servers have secured stream URLs for secure websites.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="open-graph-metadata">Open Graph Metadata</h1>
<p>Social Media sites are the places where websites get the most referrers. So having metadata for them not just makes the website Facebook- or Twitter-friendly but it is a great addition to how it would look like when shared.</p>
<p>Making the images took waaaaay longer than I expected. I decided to add 3 mockup devices that shows the website on these devices. You can see the share preview below:</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Facebook Open Graph Preview</em></figcaption>
<br/>

<figcaption><em>Twitter Open Graph Preview</em></figcaption>
</figure>
Creating the metadata tags was made easy by using <a href="https://metatags.io/" target="_blank">Metatags.io</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
<h1 id="site-icons">Site Icons</h1>
<p>I went on to also update the website&rsquo;s favicons, to differentiate tunein to the news website. It now has the Android app icon below:</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><em>Website Favicon</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<h1 id="google-ads">Google Ads</h1>
<p>I replaced the part suggesting other methods to tunein (Zeno app, Radio Garden and our native Android app) with a Google Auto ad.</p>
<p>We all hate ads but this is the only modest way to profit for most websites.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="htaccess-to-remove-html">.htaccess to Remove .html</h1>
<p>I finally made it to work, shorten the address for site navigation. Instead of showing the full file name: <pre><small>tunein.rpnradio.com/batac.html</small></pre>
Some rules were added to the .htaccess file to make it <pre><small>tunein.rpnradio.com/batac</small></pre></p>
<p>.htaccess file:</p>
<pre><code>RewriteEngine On 
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off 
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]

RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} /([^.]+)\.html [NC]
RewriteRule ^ /%1 [NC,L,R]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}.html -f
RewriteRule ^ %{REQUEST_URI}.html [NC,L]
</code></pre>
<br/>
<h1 id="footer-finally">Footer Finally</h1>
<p>I added a subtle footer to the whole website. That&rsquo;s it. :)
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="final-words">Final Words</h1>
<p>This website is another medium for the company&rsquo;s aim for a greater reach by expanding to Digital Media. In addition to our native apps (which is available for Android - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rpnradio.radiov1&hl=en&gl=US" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a> and <a href="https://appgallery.huawei.com/#/app/C103076031" target="_blank">Huawei App Gallery</a>), the website also serves a means for our audiences to access our stations' broadcast anytime and anywhere in the world.</p>

    <title>Developing for Apple Soon</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/developing-for-apple-soon/</link>
    <pubDate>Sat, 06 Feb 2021 00:40:14 &#43;0800</pubDate><dc:creator>David</dc:creator><guid>https://reddavid.me/developing-for-apple-soon/</guid>

            </div><h1 id="apple-user---me">Apple User -&gt; Me</h1>
<p>Yes, I gave in to use an Apple device. Well, I&rsquo;ve tried an iPhone XS before, and I must admit, having a device with software dedicated to its hardware is chef&rsquo;s kiss. That&rsquo;s what I liked about Apple, the hardware and software work along each other, and like most people, the price-tag for their phones held me back until December.</p>
<p>I <em>loaned</em> for an iPhone 11 since the iPhone 12 is expensive and I like the 11&rsquo;s grip instead of the sharp edges of the new design. I got a yellow one since the black sold out. Then I realized black, though very simple, is such a generic color that it doesn&rsquo;t stand out as a phone&rsquo;s color and I&rsquo;ve had too many black phones before.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Yellow iPhone 11</em></figcaption>

<br/>
<h1 id="developing-for-ios-soon">Developing for iOS soon</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to learn new things and finally applying the cross-platform capabilities of <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin/xamarin-forms">Xamarin.Forms</a> which I have used in some of my Android apps and it&rsquo;s <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/">C#</a>. I also want to check out native code from Apple, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a>.</p>
<p>Developing for Apple is quite costly, that you need to own a Mac (or rent online) and ₱4450 ($99) for an individual to publish to the App Store. And it is YEARLY.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>iOS 14 App Library (is that TikTok? 😅)</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>So, to test things out, I would be putting my app <a href="/zipcodeph-android-dark-mode/">ZIP Code PH</a> on the App Store and might set a (very very small) price to support this costly Apple environment 😂.</p>
<h1 id="for-the-meantime">For the meantime&hellip;</h1>
<p>Go ahead and check out my apps on the <a href="ms-windows-store:publisher?name=Red David">Windows 10 Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=5465762079490576029">Google Play Store</a> both under Red David.</p>
<p>See you soon!</p>

    <title>ZIP Code PH for Android gets Dark Mode</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/zipcodeph-android-dark-mode/</link>

                <img src="/images/feat/zipcodeph-android.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><h1 id="the-pandemic-and-night-owls">The Pandemic and Night Owls</h1>
<p>My app, ZIP Code PH, has been available on Google Play Store for more than a year now and because of the pandemic, more and more people are staying at home and are mostly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_owl_(person)">night-owls</a>.</p>
<p>And app and software developers are now giving their projects dark mode - not just to follow accessibility standards but offer an option for people to reduce or avoid eye strain.</p>
<h1 id="heres-dark-mode-for-ya">Here&rsquo;s Dark Mode for ya</h1>
<p>So here I am, picking up again on coding (for my apps) and started giving some apps a dark flavor. It almost took me a month to develop and test since available Xamarin Forms documentation didn&rsquo;t suit my liking.</p>
<h1 id="quick-app-features">Quick App Features</h1>
<ul>
<li>Toggle light and dark mode</li>
<li>Quick search Philippine ZIP codes</li>
<li>Favorite (Bookmark) selected ZIP codes for easy reference</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="screenshots">Screenshots</h1>
<p>See for yourself the light and dark mode for the app below.</p>
<figure class="image">

<br/>
<figure class="image">

<span style="margin: 0 10px"></span>

<figcaption><em>ZIP Code PH - List</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>I chose <code>#222222</code> as the background color for darkmode so it is easier in the eyes (at least for me and some design posts I read somewhere). If someone requests an option for a darker color, I&rsquo;d be glad to add it. (Themes, maybe? 🤔)</p>
<h1 id="make-me-happy">Make me happy</h1>
<p>Yes, please. Make me happy by downloading the app, write a review and give a rating of 5 stars.

            </div><p>This should just be a short post to promote and showcase this Android app I developed for my job.</p>
<h1 id="am-radio-in-your-pocket">AM Radio in your Pocket</h1>
<p>Choose from RPN&rsquo;s <a href="https://rpnradio.com/" target="_blank">(Radio Philippines Network)</a> 12 regional AM stations to tune into. Just connect to the internet and be updated to the latest news, talks, and enjoy some old and new tunes.</p>
<h1 id="development">Development</h1>
<p>I tried making this app using Xamarin.Forms but the new Android implementation of the media notification sucked a** that I made the app in pure <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide">Android Java code</a>.</p>
<h1 id="app-description">App Description</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>RPN&rsquo;s 12 radio stations are situated among the three major parts of the Philippines - in Luzon, we have DZRL Batac and DZBS Baguio that will give you the latest news, updates, music and other events happening in the North in Ilocano; and DZKI Iriga to offer them in Rinkonada Bikol and/or Bikolano. Next in Visayas, DYKC Cebu and DYKB Bacolod operates in the heart of Cebu City and neighboring Bacolod City, respectively. DYKC Cebu provides an programming format that will surely make all Cebuanos and Bisaya all around the world miss home. While DYKB Bacolod gives you the most important news and talkshows in Hiligaynon and/or Ilonggo. Lastly, Mindanao holds most of our stations : DXKS Surigao, DXKO Cagayan de Oro, DXDX General Santos, DXKP Pagadian, DXXX Zamboanga, and DXKT Davao.</p>
