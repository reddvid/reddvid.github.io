            </div><p>Well how about that?! I just said about how I am prone to procrastinating on my last blog post (over 2 months ago!) that I wanted to keep pisting at least once a week but guess what, I failed! 🥲</p>
<p>Though it&rsquo;s not laziness, I just didn&rsquo;t have good stories to post since it is still a pandemic over here and I just got back to work after my 2 weeks vacation (ehem, 10 days since I still kept in touch with my responsibilities - online stuff).</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just nothing to share, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But here are some highlights these past 2 months (may or may not be in particular order):</p>
<p><strong>Sleeping earlier</strong>. Visiting the province means that you <strong>MUST</strong> sleep early. Can&rsquo;t do much when waking later in the day.</p>
<p><strong>Cook my own food</strong>. I have been intending to cook a healthy meal long before but time constraints and marketing had been prevented me to do so. But with extra time I got by sleeping and waking up early I get to buy and cook a quick meal.</p>

<p><strong>Read more ebooks</strong>. I can&rsquo;t remember where I found The War of Art (yes, not Art of War). It is a book about fighting resistance of doing art (a metaphor of doing what you REALLY love). It&rsquo;s a short self-development book authored by Steven Pressfield, and later I found that it has sequels or whatever you call it: Do The Work and Turning Pro. Do The Work was originally published first but was updated (I think?) to be the follow-up of TWoA. As the book title says, when overcoming resistance DO THE WORK. Lastly, Turning Pro is about escaping the amateur life (of doing work).</p>
<p>I also stumbled upon a website called <a href="http://mostrecommendedbooks.com" target="blank_">mostrecommendedbooks.com</a>, a website where you can find a list of books which top personalities and celebrities had read. Some notable personalities I leisurely checked: Barack Obama, Bill Gates, Elon Musk (this man is futuristic and really into tech!), Dwayne &ldquo;The Rock&rdquo; Johnson, PewDiePie, Richard Branson, and Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>They all have their niche but I found that they have some mutual titles which I got interested putting into my reading list:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4069.Man_s_Search_for_Meaning" target="blank_">Mindset by Dr. Carol Dweck</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34890015-factfulness" target="blank_">Factfulness by Hans Rosling</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep" target="blank_">Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3228917-outliers" target="blank_">Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell</a></li>

</ul>
<p>I recommend reading <strong>&ldquo;Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning&rdquo;</strong> at least once in your life. 🙂</p>

<p><strong>Online Courses</strong>. These are some online video courses like Udemy. I am currently half-way through Microsoft Office 2019 course. I still have Flutter/Dart development, Web development, and UI with Figma development courses on <a href="https://udemy.com/" target="blank_">Udemy</a> and some on other sites.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The beautiful thing about learning is nobody can take it away from you.&rdquo; - B.B. King</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>These are the amazing things happened for the past months except the first two didn&rsquo;t last since my girlfriend recently got a graveyard shift work where we can only talk at around 2:30am (GMT+8) during her (lunch) break. Don&rsquo;t blame me, I&rsquo;m just a loving person 😂.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about work, it is stressful at times with at least two meetings per week and August was a one hell of ride for the website to migrate and apparently, that was also the month the hosting service will conduct a maintenance. 😬 Despite that, I&rsquo;ve learnt about a few basic things for site security and database optimizations.</p>
<p>There were also a few more layout and quality updates which I will share soon. But you can see what I&rsquo;ve worked on <a href="https://rpnradio.com" target="blank_">rpnradio.com</a> and <a href="https://tunein.rpnradio.com" target="blank_">tunein.rpnradio.com</a>.</p>
<p>As for the company&rsquo;s mobile apps - updates are still pending. I am hoping for a wider schedule to keep my &ldquo;programming momentum&rdquo; uninterrupted because once I started I can&rsquo;t stop until the code works. Trust me, unless I can&rsquo;t figure it out and need a good night&rsquo;s sleep to come up with a fix.</p>
<p>Lastly, on my very very free time, I can get to play and record playing the guitar and upload to my <a href="https://youtube.com/RedDavid" target="blank_">YouTube</a> channel. Feel free to like or dislike. 🤣 I also compensate some time to stream on <a href="https://twitch.tv/reddavidgg" target="blank_">Twitch</a> for a few hours.</p>
<p>I hope these are enough to keep you updated. I will also post some tech buys I did to give myself back for the hard-work I believe I do. Hit me up in <a href="twitter.com/reddvid" target="blank_">Twitter</a> or <a href="facebook.com/reddavidgg" target="blank_">Facebook</a> on how your last two months went!</p>

            </div><p>Okay, hear me out, I am still procrastinating after watching hours TED Talks and YouTube videos on how to be productive and avoid wasting time doing senseless things. What&rsquo;s wrong? Do I have a lot on my mind or in my hands to keep me posting blogs? Can&rsquo;t be motivated by self-help books and videos? Am I still waiting for when &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too late&rdquo;? AARGH</p>
<p></p>

<h1 id="hunyo">Hunyo</h1>
<p>So my last post was June 12, I celebrated my 29th birthday on the 14th and got me self an Elgato HD60S+ to achieve better mobile gaming mirroring but that still, I can&rsquo;t keep my streaming schedule! AARGH (2)</p>
<p>I got the thingy not just to stream games but for future use - like recording &ldquo;How to use this app&rdquo; for YouTube or presentations, so it may be an expensive thing but I always think of them as investment for my app development journey.</p>
<figure><figcaption>

<p>Speaking of streaming, I started streaming on Twitch! Right now, I planned on playing Minecraft, Left 4 Dead 2, and Call of Duty: Mobile. Also, I will try to stream on MWFS schedule playing those games or variety. <a href="https://twitch.tv/RedDavidGG" target="_blank">Give me a follow</a> and get notified when I go live.</p>
<p>I will be using my <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG" target="_blank">Facebook Page</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/rKnJb4J" target="_blank">Discord server</a> to post updates.</p>
<h3 id="stream-setup-mobile-gaming">Stream Setup (Mobile Gaming)</h3>
<p>As of this writing, I am lucky enough to have this setup for mobile game streaming:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://shp.ee/znd3exz" target="_blank">Apple iPhone 11</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Any more happened last week of June? Hmm. Yeah right, I released an update for RPN Radio app for both Android and iOS adding a call-to-action button to send the stations a message thru Facebook Messenger. This was after watching on Udemy that apps or any products always have a goal-in-mind - the stations should increase inquiries for advertisement or any other public service comments.</p>
<p>The app is still available for <strong>FREE</strong> on Google Play Store, Huawei App Store, and iOS App Store. I created this simple app landing page for the <a href="https://tunein.rpnradio.com/download" target="_blank">links.</a></p>

<p>I also got to try the new <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11" target="_blank">Windows 11 Insider Preview</a> on a VM. Tested on my main machine but I can&rsquo;t risk the beta so I rolled back to Windows 10.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start the month with a sweet treat, homemade chocolates courtesy of my SO. Anyone interested? Hit the like on the Instagram post below for us to start selling them. 😊</p>

<p>I got my second dose of Covid vaccine (Sinovac) on the 6th, thankfully there were no side-effects except for the body aches I got after NOT SLEEPING WELL! 🤦‍♂️</p>
<p>With work, I updated the <a href="https://rpnradio.com" target="_blank">RPN website</a> overall layout after migrating to a new hosting provider. And some minor updates to some if not all the online systems.</p>

<p>After that, I decided to take a <del>short</del> long break to escape the <del>jungle</del> NCR Bubble by going home to Pangasinan. I am so longing to be with the family after 6+ months of not going home - I went home last December 2020 to spend the holidays.</p>
<p>I was so looking forward to at least visit a beach, see a sunset, feel the breeze of fresh air but UNLUCKILY the weather ahead was not well! I did not see the predictions that there will be a coming storm for the week. So the first few days were a bust, and I just stayed inside and chilled out with some beer.</p>
<p>The 20th was a holiday, and magically the weather was at least fine for us to go to Binmaley beach - don&rsquo;t worry, there were no crowds so we can be safe, I think? The sun was peeping through the clouds and by the afternoon, a mild rain poured. Together with relatives, we spend some time there swimming, singing, EATING, and drinking booze until it&rsquo;s time to go home.</p>

<p>My other plans went down the drain as the weather became worse, Dagupan City was flooded (plus high tide) that light vehicles weren&rsquo;t able to pass. Sadly, I can&rsquo;t meet my <del>only</del> city friends. There&rsquo;s still next time right? Right?</p>
<p>I decided to extend my stay but continued checking some online responsibilities just to make sure they are still up even I&rsquo;m not present in the office - though I failed to join our online meetings.</p>
<p>We also went to our grandfather&rsquo;s brother to celebrate his 70th birthday. Then we spent some time (and over pizza) with my cousin to talk about tech and stuff.</p>

                <img src="/images/feat/codm-fbgg-streaming.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>This is a post to ask my SMP members to forgive by not playing for a while (a week) on our Minecraft server. I will also share my setup how I stream mobile games.</p>
<h1 id="grind-to-legend">Grind to Legend</h1>
<p>Ever since the new season of Call of Duty: Mobile came out, I just wanted to redeem the legendary medal. And also to get all rewards from the Battle Pass I bought. 😂</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry guys and gals, kuya Red will be back soon. Konti na lang back to Legendary rank na sa BR mode at pwede na mag-Minecraft.</p>
<figure><figcaption>
            <h4>Locked Legendary Rank</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h1 id="minecraft-117-is-out">Minecraft 1.17 is out</h1>
<p>Spigot 1.17 is out and is now available as an option for our server but the plugins are currently unsupported, so we&rsquo;ll stick to 1.16.5. Though I played the snapshots and pre-releases, I am still yet to play Minecraft 1.17 Vanilla.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0maWbr0FHKY" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>The caves and cliffs update (part 1) brings new items and features which were detailed on Minecraft&rsquo;s own blog <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/updates/caves-and-cliffs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now on to my setup.</p>
<h1 id="setup">Setup</h1>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s see the devices I use except for the laptop/PC for streaming.</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone 11</li>
<li>Lightning to AV Digital Adapter</li>
<li>HDMI cable</li>
<li>Cheap video capture</li>
<li>Audio-technica Condenser Mic</li>
</ul>
<p>I used to play on my Nokia 7 Plus but can&rsquo;t the specs can&rsquo;t keep up, not sure why. This is when I use <a href="https://www.vysor.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vysor</a>, a screen mirroring app that wirelessly share the phone&rsquo;s screen to the PC. Now, that&rsquo;s where the problem is, wireless mirroring makes the sound delayed that playing action games is not a good experience. I invested in both an iPhone and the adapter since I can use them on future projects - software development.</p>
<figure><figcaption>
            <h4>Lightning to AV Adapter and USB Capture Card</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I wonder why branded capture cards are so damn expensive?! Like the <a href="https://ecommerce.datablitz.com.ph/products/elgato-hd60-s-game-capture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elgato HD60S</a> and <a href="https://ecommerce.datablitz.com.ph/products/avermedia-live-gamer-ultra-game-streaming-capture-box-gc553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AverMedia Live Gamer Ultra</a>. So I went ahead and bought a $6 (300 pesos) unbranded USB capture card and it just works fine. Just stick it well on a USB port and it&rsquo;s good to go.</p>
<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3o6MbtelsDZdsbFB7i" width="480" height="360" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto;"></iframe>
<p>Lastly, I recently bought an <a href="https://www.audio-technica.com/en-gb/atr2500x-usb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ATR-2500X condenser mic</a> to record songs and guitars for my YouTube channel. Now it&rsquo;s multi-purpose that I use it on my streams and Zoom meetings.</p>
<figure><figcaption>
            <h4>Audio-Technica ATR2500X Condenser Mic</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>As for the software, I use <a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OBS Studio</a>. I had a bad experience using SLOBS, it freezes and crashes over simple things. I used to do overlays with Streamlabs but then I found StreamElements OBS.Live. It makes things much easier with a direct &ldquo;Go Live&rdquo; button on OBS Studio, chat box, and activity feed. They also provide a nice overlay editor with text-to-speech system on their <a href="https://streamelements.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>.</p>
<figure><figcaption>
            <h4>StreamElements OBS.Live Plugin</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="diagram">Diagram</h2>
<p>This is how my setup is connected. Remember that you need an internet with at least 4000kbps of upload speed to actually stream your games on Facebook Gaming (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/fbgaminghome/creators/getstarted" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>). I stream at 1080p60 with 6000kbps bitrate.</p>
<figure><figcaption>
            <h4>Hardware Setup Diagram</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h1 id="games-list">Games List</h1>
<p>I have a few mobile games on my phone right now compared to my <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/reddvid/games/?tab=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Library</a>. But I own some mobile-worthy games like Stardew Valley and Minecraft: Pocket Edition.</p>
<p>I have a love and hate relationship with games like PUBG Mobile and Mobile Legends. I am looking forward to Apex Legends: Mobile and Diablo Immortal though. They&rsquo;re both are already in beta preview on Android, currently waiting for the iPhone/iPad version.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.me/reddavidgg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Send me a message</a> to request a game I can play. Or we can play together.</p>
<h1 id="support-me-on-facebook-gaming">Support me on Facebook Gaming</h1>
<p>This seems repetitive but I do need some support when I go live. It feels like streaming and talking to friends is now an everyday duty, haha. But kidding aside, everyone needs help.</p>
<p>Check me <a href="https://fb.gg/reddavidgg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and let&rsquo;s talk more about tech and things.</p>

    <title>OBS Studio 27 is here</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/obs-27-is-here/</link>

    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/feat/obs27.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>I just updated my OBS a few days ago with the official release version after trying out the several release candidates.</p>
<p>I will talk about the new features and improvements here that will be useful for my use. Check their blog post <a href="https://obsproject.com/blog/obs-studio-27-released" target="_blank">here</a> and the complete changelog <a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/27.0.0" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
<br>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LUkMxYNIyj0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<br>
<h1 id="undo--redo-5000">Undo &amp; Redo (5000)</h1>
<p>At last! No more annoyances when you just ACCIDENTALLY move something on the canvas. Undo and redo is here for every change you do in your sources and scenes - not sure for all filters though. And that’s 5000 actions.</p>
<p>Though I mostly use OBS for game streaming (no facecam), I move things around only to notice that it was not the source I wanted to move! This surely helps users out and always had been the most requested feature.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="files-where">Files, where?</h1>
<p>Version 27 also added a missing files window prompt on launch that allows us to relocate or ignore the missing files. Nice addition so we don’t go start streaming only to have the files missing.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Missing Files Warning Window</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<h1 id="no-more-noise">No More Noise</h1>
<p>OBS v27 for Windows now adds NVIDIA Noise Removal as an option to audio Noise Suppression filter when the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-sdk/resources/" target="_blank">NVIDIA Audio Effects SDK</a> is installed. Oh, also you need an NVIDIA RTX GPU for that - so no screenshots from me.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="improvements">Improvements</h1>
<p>Thanks for these 2 new improvements among others:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browser Source interact button (toolbar)</li>
<li>Virtual Camera toggle button (system tray)</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image">

<br/>
<br>
<h1 id="fin">Fin</h1>
<p>This new version of OBS Studio definitely helps with the new added features. Now I want a selective record feature.</p>
<p>I use OBS Studio together with <a href="https://streamelements.com/" target="_blank">StreamElements</a> OBS Live to simplify my stream setup to Facebook Gaming. I now have 1,019 followers (as of this writing) and why not check me out there? Maybe talk about gaming, life, or programming? <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG/" target="_blank">RedDavidGG on Facebook Gaming</a></p>
<p>I dedicate the starwall page for my stars-sender. Thanks and make sure to check out OBS Studio’s latest release <a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

    <title>RPN Radio UI Overhaul</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/rpnradio-ui-overhaul/</link>
    <pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 00:15:36 &#43;0800</pubDate>
    <author>Author</author>

    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/feat/rpnradio-ui.jpeg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>Browsing Instagram on my account now floods me with several UI/UX tips and practices, making me inspired to update and retouch my apps with some latest trends in mobile designs.</p>
<h1 id="old-look">Old Look</h1>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at what the app looked like before the update:</p>
<figure class="image">


<figcaption><em>Old UI</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>Though it looked intuitive - with just two simple steps: 1) Launch app, 2) Select station and Listen; the main page does not give the user context on what the app does, which raise this question:</p>
<p><strong><em>What am I supposed to do?</em></strong></p>
<h2 id="menu-list">Menu List</h2>
<p>At first glance of a first-time user, the stations list does NOT show that it is &ldquo;clickable&rdquo;. So the first UI update was to change the 4x3 grid to a simple list.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Station Menu Item Before and After</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>This subtle change provides the user a hint of &ldquo;click me&rdquo; by giving the list item a design of a button. It also gave a space for the station&rsquo;s detail to be added - station&rsquo;s location and live/offline status.</p>
<h2 id="header-and-controls">Header and Controls</h2>
<p>Ok, this area will look crammed especially on small-screen devices. Before this update though, I repositioned the buttons below the controls and were still crammed. This update allowed the horizontal list to be scrolled.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Header & Controls Before and After</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>I also changed the text that shows the current stations into a simpler one and updated the share icon.</p>
<h2 id="new-font">New Font</h2>
<p>I like <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Poppins</a>.
<br></p>
<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>Besides the UI updates mentioned above, I added an &ldquo;About&rdquo; page. It is a simple about and external links of RPN.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>About page</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<h1 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h1>
<p>These are my to-do list for the app, which we will see soon on future updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>No internet connection status</li>
<li>Bottom player controls (Priority)</li>
<li>App-aware sharing</li>
<li>Rate and review prompt</li>
<li>Links to station email/messaging</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="downloads">Downloads</h1>
<p>As always, the app is still available for Android and (REALLY) soon for iOS.</p>
<p>Google Play Store: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rpnradio.radiov1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rpnradio.radiov1</a></p>

    <title>Unlocked: 1K Followers</title>
    <link>https://reddavid.me/unlocked-1k-followers/</link>

    <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/feat/1k-followers.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>First of all, thank you so much to all who stayed, watched, and enjoyed my content.</p>
<p>It was on May 26th that we finally got to a thousand following after a year of starting to be a Gaming Video Creator on Facebook. The stream felt like another day of chill streaming by playing a couple of hours of Minecraft. It was quite overwhelming for a small-time (and not full-time) streamer like me but thanks to my cousins and og supporters for helping me out in the chat and Discord server.</p>
<figure class="image">

</figure>
<br/>
<h1 id="strikedailystrike-nightly-streams"><strike>Daily</strike> Nightly Streams</h1>
<p>Now that there&rsquo;s that 1K following behind me, I will pursue to stream on a daily basis, even a short one because honestly, I miss talking and updating with them. I will also continue to improve my stream quality.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="not-minecraft-hello">Not Minecraft, Hello?</h1>
<p>Minecraft is a really popular game we all know that, and most of my followers were because of the game. I do not expect everyone to like me playing variety of games but I still hope most could support me when I come back playing other types of games. Although, I would still join our SMP server if I fail to stream Minecraft.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="twitchyoutube-switch">Twitch/YouTube Switch</h1>
<p>Yes, I have been thinking of switching to either one, why? First, Twitch have several audience interaction which I have been using when I watch my favorite streamers there like, watch points, play with viewers, etc and you can watch on app minimized.</p>
<figure class="image">

<figcaption><em>Watch Twitch Videos Minimized</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>While YouTube had a better chat system, but chat highlights and audience interactions are better - with chatbots.</p>
<p>I held back these thoughts before since I did start my Facebook page a long time and gained a few followers. I just hoped if I made up my mind to switch, we can determine the real supporters. Maybe?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for this blog post. Thank you again for visiting my website and you can catch up on my Gaming Videos on <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook Gaming</a> and follower me there. You can also follow me on my socials: @reddvid</p>

    <title>Streaming Again &amp; Minecraft SMP Season 2</title>

                <img src="/images/feat/mc-smp-s02.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>Rejoice! My more-than-a-month-long hiatus finally came to an end - I&rsquo;m back to streaming video games in Facebook Gaming. In just 2 days, I&rsquo;ve managed to garner a whopping 8+ hours as compared before.</p>
<p>This also means that I am back to relieving some stress thru my beloved game Minecraft, (Survival Mode).</p>
<h1 id="first-world">First World?</h1>
<p>The first server I rented became <strike>toxic</strike> unenjoyable after a few months after opening it into the public - NO it&rsquo;s not because of the new players, but because the server was technically &ldquo;DONE&rdquo; by having usable XP farms, stripped mines, food source, and other auto AFK farms. Which meant that new players have nothing more to do but mess around most of the time.</p>
<p>I tried to reload the server with a new world but it kept corrupting upto the point that I reverted it back to the older (toxic) world. And I stopped playing less and less.</p>
<h1 id="refreshed-and-new-season-two">Refreshed and New? SEASON TWO</h1>
<p>Yes, after I decided to stream again, I hastily rented a new server and invite some of my OG followers to play with me. As of now, the world is still peaceful and managed to invite more players in hoping we can live happily in the upcoming days.</p>
<p>Unlike before, the server is now Offline-mode, meaning that non-Mojang accounts can now join - be CAREFUL though, WE CAN STILL <strong>BAN</strong> YOU.</p>
<h2 id="wanna-join">Wanna join?</h2>
<p>Head over to our Discord server for the rules and guidelines, and for the Server IP.</p>

<h1 id="hello-1k-followers">Hello 1K Followers</h1>
<p>I have been aiming to reach followers before the year 2020 ends but I failed to do so, much more that I stopped streaming for more than a month.</p>
<p>Now with regained confidence, I am on the path to reach that goal while improving my streaming. So head over to my <a href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook Gaming Page</a> and see if you like me to gain a Follow!</p>
<h1 id="looking-for-support">✨Looking for Support</h1>
<p>Also, I tried streaming mobile games now and then but the current setup is not suited for it. I am slowly building funds to get the setup for mobile games too.</p>

<p>You can get the app from App Store (iPhone and iPad) for only Php49 (US$0.99) - sorry for the paywall. I&rsquo;m still a struggling developer and just to let you know, developing for Apple costs more compared to Windows and Google Play Store.</p>
<p>Get the app below: <br/>

<h1 id="lets-go">Let&rsquo;s Go</h1>
<p>For the last few weeks, I spent my free time building my app, ZIP Code PH, for iOS using Apple&rsquo;s native language SwiftUI.</p>
<p>Using a Mac is not that hard anymore since I&rsquo;ve test ran macOS Catalina on VirtualBox. I managed to run XCode and tried to tinker with the language, and built some UI mockups.</p>
<p>And luckily, the workplace has acquired a mac mini to cater Apple users for our apps (which is coming as soon as possible). I will also be the one developing the iOS apps, so check them out soon.</p>

<h2 id="main-and-about-page">Main and About Page</h2>
<p>I am fairly new to SwiftUI so converting? the codes I used for Windows and Xamarin Android app - XAML and C# - will be useless. It took a few days to build the bare UI. I started with the Main Page and the Help page since they don&rsquo;t consume a lot of code-behind.</p>
<p>The Main Page took a lot of iterations but below is the final view (as of this writing):</p>

<p>The Help/About Page contains the same details I used in the Android app except that I added attributions to the new images in the Main Page (thanks <a href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_blank">Unsplash!</a>)</p>

<h2 id="search-page">Search Page</h2>
<p>Next up is the Search Page, I coded this before the menus since the code-behind logic is much simpler since we will use all the zip codes instead of filtering them to areas.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t explorer SwiftUI that much but I found this code to build the Search bar iOS-style:</p>

<p>I spent a few times making the search (filtering) logic work the way I wanted that I almost gave up with SwiftUI programming 😅</p>
<h2 id="menu-and-area-list-page">Menu and Area List Page</h2>
<p>After understanding the filtering code while developing the Search Page, it is time to code the Menu and Area pages. The UI looks a lot like the Android counterpart but the built-in Title style for iOS makes the UI better by collapsing the title to inline when scrolled. This is how it looks like on version 1.0.4</p>

<h2 id="favorites">Favorites</h2>
<p>Now the challenge begins, how to implement favorites - saving and loading data - while making the UI flexible when an item is added to favorites.</p>
<p>After more than a week of mind-bending development, I made it to work with the help of stackoverflow 😅. (Every developer use it, right? Right?)</p>
