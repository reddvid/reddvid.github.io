            </div><p>The year 2020 has been tough for most of us but people slowly caught up and jumped right into live streaming or content creation. Facebook Gaming is one of them, it&rsquo;s like Twitch or YouTube Gaming but Facebook.</p>
<h1 id="my-journey-begins">My Journey Begins</h1>
<p>I started my Facebook Page waaaay back 2014 and started as a Page for my published apps on Microsoft store. I posted links and some promotional images, some updates about developing them, and other simple stuff.</p>
<p>I always have been a fan of PC-gaming since my high school years but with slow or lack thereof internet connectivity - I didn&rsquo;t stream all of my gaming journey of someone else to see.</p>
<p>With the start of the lockdown on March 2020, I decided to convert my Facebook Page from a Personal Blog to be a Gaming Video Creator category. Then I proceeded to live stream my gameplays of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/362890/Black_Mesa/" target="_blank">Blackmesa</a>, a fan-made rework of the infamous Half-Life game into the Source Engine. Of course, the struggle to gain viewers and followers is real - even to this day.</p>
<p>Being a casual streamer, I didn&rsquo;t have a regular schedule to build a following and this, for me is still a personal choice to <em>share</em> my gameplays to the public.</p>
<p>As time goes by, some viewers come and go, and some leave a comment for me to at least respond, and that brings additional life to my live stream. That&rsquo;s when I realized, I like someone to talk to every now and then.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="stars">Stars</h1>
<p>Being paid for content creation goes way back since YouTube, and now most platforms integrate some <em>monetization</em> to gain more users. This is where Facebook Stars come, I will just post this link on what and how Stars work on Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/903272529876480?id=648321075955172" target="_blank">About Facebook Stars</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not simple to be eligible to get stars, Facebook has a criteria for a Creator to be enabled. Firstly, make your Page category as Gaming Video Creator, have at least 100 followers, stream games on at least 2 days in one consecutive 14-day period, and stream games for at least 4 hours within the same 14-day period.</p>
<p>Even though my page old as f*ck, I only managed to grow it to only 380-ish, thankfully enough to check another one out of the criteria.</p>
<p>Streaming at least 4 hours is easy-peasy, I can do that within a day. So that&rsquo;s <strike>three</strike> four out of four criteria checked out.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="stars-please">Stars, please!</h1>
<p>That went easy, now I can have all the stars in the world. Wait, my current audience/followers were from the past!</p>
<p>My eligibility was just to enable the stars, it is still up to the community to watch me and send me their stars. Now time to gain some followers.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h1 id="growth">Growth</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ll admit, I am an introvert, I don&rsquo;t show or provide content as easily as others do. Whenever I post some creative works, it&rsquo;s a final product or just me behind the camera.</p>
<p>So growth is a problem, I tend to watch some helpful videos to find a solution to my problem: &ldquo;How to grow when you are camera-shy&rdquo; or &ldquo;How to engage an audience when you&rsquo;re not a conversationalist&rdquo;, something like those.</p>
<p>During these process, I stopped streaming until June 2020, where I (we all) had to adjust with the pandemic - work and life changes. I started by boosting my Facebook page with an ad while I stream quite regularly for a couple of hours each day.</p>
<p>For months, without a proper schedule, I am thankful to gain the followers I have now.</p>

<h1 id="mining-and-crafting-fps-and-story-modes">Mining and Crafting, FPS and Story-Modes</h1>
<p>I also started to play Minecraft again and rented a server for my survival multiplayer world - invited some of my friends to come and play. This also ticked my followers count a notch since Minecraft is a game everyone loved to play - even loved to watch! THen slowly invited some viewers to join over the months.</p>
<p>I would just want my followers (LODI&rsquo;s) to know that I play a variety of games so if ever you catch me playing another game besides Minecraft, I hope you&rsquo;d still watch me and let&rsquo;s all enjoy my niche of games. I streamed Apex Legends most of January 2021 since I find it enjoyable, Call of Duty: Mobile when playing together with my old friends, other old triple AAA games like the Far Cry series (which I can&rsquo;t afford to pay at launch), and my long-time favorite - Left 4 Dead 2.</p>

<h1 id="a-thousand-thanks">A &lsquo;Thousand&rsquo; Thanks</h1>
<p>I am now reaching a thousand (954 as of writing) slowly but surely. Reaching a follower with a letter in it (1&rsquo;K', that is) means so much to me, and achieving this will just be the start of something grander and more enjoyable to the stream.</p>
<p>As a coder, I found a way to thank my stars-sender by making a page here in my website to list their names which I called <a href="/starwall">Starwall</a>.
